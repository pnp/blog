# Microsoft 365 and Power Platform Community Blog

The [Microsoft 365 Community](https://aka.ms/m365pnp) is the virtual home for everyone who wants to extend Microsoft 365 beyond the standard. We want to share knowledge, learn from each other and achieve more together.

> Our mission is to create a single inclusive and welcoming place for everyone who wants to build on Microsoft 365.

## What can you expect here?

This blog is part of the Microsoft 365 community and complements our existing initiatives, such as our [open-source projects](https://aka.ms/m365pnp) and [Community Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/community/), where we explain how the different features of Microsoft 365 work and offer guidance on how to use them.

You can find community-authored blog posts alongside with Community Call recordings and Podcasts here.

We learned that people build solutions that span multiple Microsoft products with varying degrees of complexity, and we shouldn’t compartmentalize communities. We like to bring people together by guiding and sharing knowledge and listening to understand people’s needs. Please expect blog posts, videos, and open discussion on all kinds of topics around building on Microsoft 365. We are here to help.

Some important things that we want to achieve:

### Drop labels

We do not want to distinguish between so-called developers and citizen developers or spend much energy putting people into boxes. We want to provide guidance, knowledge, and reusable patterns and practices for everyone who wants to build on top of Microsoft 365, regardless of their profession, role, technical background, approach, or skill level. By living our Sharing is Caring mission, everyone will benefit.

### One Community

Having one community as a virtual home for everyone who wants to extend Microsoft 365 will break down information silos and broaden everyone’s horizon, which will lead to better outcomes and more connected solutions. Sharing ideas across products using no code, low-code, and coded solutions in one single place will bring our communities closer together.

### Lower entry barriers

We want to let our community grow and get new people involved, so we want to also cater to people who are not in that community right now and lower entry barriers. Helping everyone getting started rather than gate keeping is one of our primary goals.

### Being inclusive

Appreciating people from all backgrounds and with different expertise will ensure inclusiveness and improve our ability to step outside of our comfort zones and respect diverse perspectives. Learning that there is no pecking order of power users, makers, and developers but that we will be most successful when we focus on a better together approach will make a huge difference.
