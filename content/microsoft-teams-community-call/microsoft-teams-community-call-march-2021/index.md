## Call summary


This month's community call featured latest look at the **Teams Sample
Repository** (consolidated sample code Repo for Teams platform), then
two Community Sample Showcase entries:  **Business to Citizen Consumer
Communication Bot** (allows citizen end-users with no Teams license to
engage a business licensed user in a real-time Teams chat), and **Bot
Composer** (create a simple bot, install it in Teams and have it calling
the Graph in 15 minutes!), followed by a presentation on **Utilizing
Mobile First Device Capabilities for Teams Apps** (how developers are
able to extend hardware capabilities in mobile devices to build richer
mobile apps), and a 10-minute **Q&A**.   The call was hosted by Jun Pak
(Microsoft).  Microsoft presenters included Wajeed Shaikh, Sathya
Raveendran, Arun Kumar Anaparthi, Bob German, Anuj Bahl and Shubham
Chauhan.  Recorded on February 16, 2021.  Thank for attending the call
or viewing on demand. 

## Demos

**Business to Citizen Consumer Communication Bot** -- sample allows
citizen end-users with no Teams license to engage a business licensed
user in a real-time Teams chat and vice versa, using a consumer chat
channel.  Chat conversations may be escalated into a call/meetings with
anonymous (guest) users.  Allows quick and easy file/image transfers and
handling of multiple chat sessions in parallel with clear user
attribution in each chat thread.   Uses Graph APIs for chat and file
transfers.

 

**Bot Composer** create a simple bot, install it in Teams and have it
calling the Graph in 15 minutes!  Step-by-step - Name your bot, add a
trigger, use ngrok to make bot work in Teams, register bot, create an
app (in App Studio), install bot locally, connect it to the Graph,
create trigger to respond with person's title from profile, ask question
in Teams!        

 

**Utilizing Mobile First Device Capabilities for Teams Apps** -- four
device capabilities (Image, Location, Mic, and Scanner APIs) now in
Teams Client JS SDK that developers can utilize for extending bots,
tabs, messaging extensions and personal apps, in mobile apps.   Reviewed
mobile device capabilities Roadmap, 3 UI demos, and scenarios with API
configurations.  Have a look at the mobile People Picker Control in
development.  API documentation with code snippets is current.
