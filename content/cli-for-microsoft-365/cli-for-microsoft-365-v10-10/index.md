The CLI for Microsoft 365 strikes again! We've just published a new minor version of the CLI for Microsoft 365. [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to manage your Microsoft 365 tenant and SharePoint Framework projects. This minor release introduces new commands and improvements that will enhance the quality of your Microsoft 365 experience.

> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) for a neat overview of all the exciting features and improvements. 

## What's New

### Microsoft Entra ID

Need to change your company’s display name, privacy-statement link or the addresses that receive Microsoft service notifications? The brand-new `m365 entra organization set` command lets you do exactly that, without touching the portal.

Updates properties of an organization specified by displayName

```sh
m365 entra organization set --displayName Contoso --marketingNotificationEmails 'marketing@contoso.com'
```

For more information, check the following resource:

- [entra organization set](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/organization/organization-set)

### SharePoint Online

Cleaning up pages just got easier: `m365 spo page control remove` deletes any control by its GUID—no page design manager required.

Remove a control from a SharePoint page, with confirmation

```sh
m365 spo page control remove --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Marketing --pageName home.aspx --id b3d6ebc9-6c7b-4e1e-99c1-4c08b682e8c1
```

## What's changed

This release also brings some other great changes. Aside from many improvements in the codebase and bug fixes to elevate the overall CLI experience, there are several important updates we'd like to highlight.

### Minimal-permissions documentation

We're introducing a "Permissions" section on each command's documentation page. This section outlines the minimum required permissions an account or app needs to run the command with full functionality. Currently, all `planner` command docs are updated with this new section. Updating all pages will take some time, so feel free to contribute if you'd like to help!

### SharePoint Online Enhancements

Building modern SharePoint experiences is now a lot easier. You can add Calendar, Gallery, and Kanban views straight from the CLI with [spo list view add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/list/list-view-add), giving lists the visual flair and task-board functionality they deserve. At the same time, [spo page section add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/page/page-section-add) introduces support for Flexible sections. Web parts can be moved anywhere on the two-dimensional grid within flexible sections. Together, these enhancements make it simple to craft information-rich layouts and views without leaving your terminal.
