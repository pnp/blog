## What's new

### New Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management commands

Microsoft Entra [Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) is a service in Microsoft Entra ID that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. These resources include resources in Microsoft Entra ID, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.

This release of [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) includes additional commands that allow you to get a list of requests for roles and a list of eligible roles a user can be assigned to.

To get a list of PIM requests for a **user** or **group**, run:

```sh
m365 entra pim role request list
```

To get a list of PIM requests pending approval for the current user, run:

```sh
m365 entra pim role request list --userId '@meID' --status PendingApproval
```

To get a list of eligible roles for a **user** or **group**, run:

```sh
m365 entra pim role assignment eligibility list
```

To get a list of eligible roles for the current user, run:

```sh
m365 entra pim role assignment eligibility list --userId '@meID'
```

- [m365 entra pim role assignment eligibility list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/pim/pim-role-assignment-eligibility-list)

### New Microsoft Entra ID commands

We've added a new command around permission management in Entra ID. An area that the CLI for Microsoft 365 shines in. While we already supported managing delegated and application permissions on enterprise applications, managing permissions of App Registrations was not fully covered. This release brings a new command to achieve that purpose.

To remove multiple delegated API permissions from an Entra ID app, run:

```sh
m365 entra app permission remove --appId 'f1417aa3-bf0b-4cc5-a845-a0b2cf11f690' --delegatedPermissions 'https://management.azure.com/user_impersonation https://service.flow.microsoft.com/Flows.Read.All https://graph.microsoft.com/Agreement.Read.All'
```

To remove multiple delegated API permissions from an Entra ID app and revoke admin consent, run:

```sh
m365 entra app permission remove --appId 'f1417aa3-bf0b-4cc5-a845-a0b2cf11f690' --applicationPermissions 'https://graph.microsoft.com/Sites.FullControl.All https://microsoft.sharepoint-df.com/Sites.FullControl.All' --revokeAdminConsent
```

### New SharePoint commands

Microsoft 365 Archive offers cost-effective storage for inactive SharePoint sites. Many organizations want to retain inactive data, but may also wrestle with rising storage costs. Microsoft 365 Archive allows you to retain this inactive data by moving it into cold storage within SharePoint. The CLI for Microsoft 365 now has new commands to archive and unarchive sites.

To archive a SharePoint site, run:

```sh
m365 spo tenant site archive --url "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Marketing"
```

To unarchive a SharePoint site, run:

```sh
m365 spo tenant site unarchive --url "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Marketing"
```

In this release we're also adding the ability to list site administrators.

To list all admins of a SharePoint site, run:

```sh
m365 spo site admin list --siteUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com
```

To list all admins of a SharePoint site, as a SharePoint administrator without access to the site, run:

```sh
m365 spo site admin list --siteUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com --asAdmin
```

For more information, check the following resources:
- [m365 spo tenant site archive](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/tenant/tenant-site-archive)
- [m365 spo tenant site unarchive](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/tenant/tenant-site-unarchive)
- [m365 spo site admin list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/site/site-admin-list)

### New Microsoft Teams command

Using the CLI, it was already possible to install and uninstall apps in the personal scope of a user in Teams. We've now added a new command to upgrade such an app installation to the latest version.

To upgrade an app by name for the specified user, run:

```sh
m365 teams user app upgrade --name HelloWorld --userName admin@contoso.com
```

For more information, check the following resources:
- [m365 teams user app upgrade](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/teams/user/user-app-upgrade)

## What's changed

Besides all these new commands, we've also made some changes to some existing commands. A few bugs have been fixed and the codebase has been polished. Changes include an enhancement when [adding folders in SharePoint](#adding-folders-in-sharepoint).

### Adding folders in SharePoint

It's now possible to ensure a create a new folder recursively. The entire folder path will be created if necessary using the new `--ensureParentFolders` option. 

To create a folder an ensure all parent folders in the path are created as well, run:

```sh
m365 spo folder add --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --parentFolderUrl '/Projects/2024/Q1/Reports' --name Financial --ensureParentFolders
```

- [m365 spo folder add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/folder/folder-add)

## Upcoming changes

Curious about what lies ahead? We are excited to share some of our ongoing projects and initiatives. We have some commands pertaining to [Multitenant organization capabilities in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/overview) which are in the pipeline and will be released in the upcoming versions.
