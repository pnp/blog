## Spring Cleaning: what it is all about

Most of us are familiar with spring cleaning; as it refers to the process of thoroughly cleaning and organizing a space, typically performed during the spring season. And of course in the context of software development it is no different. Spring cleaning usually involves tackling long-standing issues or tasks that have been ignored or postponed. It is an opportunity to address potential accumulated technical debt, resolve bugs, and enhance the overall quality of the codebase. So we decided to take this opportunity to clean up the CLI for Microsoft 365 codebase and make it even better than before. And we do need your help for that üßº!
