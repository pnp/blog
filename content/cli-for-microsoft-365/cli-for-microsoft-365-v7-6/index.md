> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) to discover an array of exciting features and improvements that will revolutionize your Microsoft 365 journey. 
 
## What's new

### New Purview threat assessment commands

The release includes additional management features for Purview. We added two new commands that will allow you to list and create threat assessments. Let's see it in action. 

To list all threat assessments, simply run:

```sh
m365 purview threatassessment list
```

You may also filter them by type, for example, to list threat assessments of type mail run:

```sh
m365 purview threatassessment list --type mail
```

To create a file threat assessment:

```sh
m365 purview threatassessment add --type file --expectedAssessment block --category malware --fileName 'test.txt' --path 'C:\Path\To\File.txt'
```

Or to create a URL threat assessment run:

```sh
m365 purview threatassessment add --type url --expectedAssessment block --category phishing --url 'http://contoso.com'
```

- [m365 purview threatassessment add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/purview/threatassessment/threatassessment-add/)

### Generate Azure DevOps Pipeline for an SPFx project

Till now CLI for Microsoft 365 allowed you to generate a CI/CD workflow for your SharePoint Framework project using the [m365 spfx project github workflow add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spfx/project/project-github-workflow-add/) command. In this release, we extended this capability and added the support for Azure DevOps Pipelines. It's important to understand that the command will not create the Azure DevOps pipeline. You will need to manually create it in Azure DevOps. The command will only create the workflow file which you can then push to your repo and create a new YAML pipeline based on it. The command needs to be run in the context of your SharePoint Framework project. The created .yml file will be present in the `.azuredevops/pipelines` directory in your project.

To add an Azure DevOps Pipeline for an SPFx project triggered on push to `main`, simply run: 

```sh
m365 spfx project azuredevops pipeline add
```

To add an Azure DevOps Pipeline for an SPFx project with `user` login method triggered on push to `dev` branch:

```sh
m365 spfx project azuredevops pipeline add --loginMethod "user" --branchName "dev"
```

To add an Azure DevOps Pipeline for an SPFx project with deployment to a site collection app catalog:

```sh
m365 spfx project azuredevops pipeline add --scope "sitecollection" --siteUrl "https://some.sharepoint.com/sites/someSite"
```

### More features to manage your Outlook messages

CLI for Microsoft 365 already has several commands that allow you to manage Outlook messages. In this release, we added a new command that allows you to permanently remove a specific message from a mailbox.

To remove a specific message for the currently signed-in user:

```sh
m365 outlook message remove --id AAMkAGVmMDEzMTM4LTZmYWUtNDdkNC1hMDZiLTU1OGY5OTZhYmY4OABGAAAAAAAiQ8W967B7TKBjgx9rVEURBwAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAAAAAAEMAAAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAALvuv07AAA=
```

To remove a specific message from a specific mailbox specified by user ID using application permissions:

```sh
m365 outlook message remove --id AAMkAGVmMDEzMTM4LTZmYWUtNDdkNC1hMDZiLTU1OGY5OTZhYmY4OABGAAAAAAAiQ8W967B7TKBjgx9rVEURBwAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAAAAAAEMAAAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAALvuv07AAA= --userId 6799fd1a-723b-4eb7-8e52-41ae530274ca
```

To remove a specific message in a shared mailbox:

```sh
m365 outlook message remove --id AAMkAGVmMDEzMTM4LTZmYWUtNDdkNC1hMDZiLTU1OGY5OTZhYmY4OABGAAAAAAAiQ8W967B7TKBjgx9rVEURBwAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAAAAAAEMAAAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAALvuv07AAA= --userName sharedmailbox@contoso.com
```

### Retrieve retirement report of SharePoint Add-Ins and Azure ACS

Microsoft has announced that SharePoint Add-ins and Azure ACS will be retired and as a result will stop working for new tenants as of November 1st, 2024 and they will stop working for existing tenants as of April 2nd, 2026. It's important to remember those dates and migrate your existing Add-in projects to SharePoint Framework-based solutions. In a large tenant that has many customizations, it may be hard to find all the places that require your attention. Thankfully CLI for Microsoft 365 may be the answer to that problem.

One of our contributors added a new script that allows us to get information about retirement-related components from a selected tenant. It covers key elements such as event receivers, SharePoint Add-ins, and Azure Access Control Service (ACS). If you are eager to find out more check out the [script in our docs](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/sample-scripts/spo/sp-add-ins-and-azure-acs-retirement-report/).

## What's changed

Besides all these new commands, we've also made some changes to the existing commands. A few bugs have been fixed and the codebase has been polished. Some of our existing commands also got improved like the `spo folder add/set` commands that now have the possibility to set the folder color. Another great example is the `spo site recyclebinitem restore` that now has two new options that allow you to restore all items from the first and/or second-stage recycle bin.

If you are eager to go over all of the details and improvements added in this release, do not hesitate to check out the [release notes](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/about/release-notes#v760) to find out more.
