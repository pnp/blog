Our CLI for Microsoft 365 now features **8 new commands**, giving you control over various Microsoft 365 services. From SharePoint Application Customizers to sensitivity labels and Azure Active Directory. Get ready to elevate your productivity and dive into a world of possibilities!

### SharePoint Management

We've introduced new commands to enhance your SharePoint management experience. Now, it's easier than ever to handle Application Customizers, discard checked-out files, and manage tenant-wide ListView Command Sets. Check out the details below:

Update the title of an application customizer on the sales site:

```sh
m365 spo applicationcustomizer set --id 058140e3-0e37-44fc-a1d3-79c487d371a3 --newTitle "Some customizer" --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sales
```

Discard a checked-out file with a specific ID:

```sh
m365 spo file checkout undo --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --fileId 'b2307a39-e878-458b-bc90-03bc578531d6'
```

Applies a sensitivity label by ID to a document library using the list title:

```sh
m365 spo list sensitivitylabel ensure --webUrl 'https://contoso.sharepoint.com' --listTitle 'Shared Documents' --id '0d39dc11-75ff-4309-8b32-ff94f0e41607'
```

Update the title of a tenant-wide deployed Application Customizer by its ID:

```sh
m365 spo tenant applicationcustomizer set --id 3 --newTitle "Some customizer"
```

Add a tenant-wide deployed ListView Command Set to CommandBars of Lists:

```sh
m365 spo tenant commandset add --title "Some customizer" --clientSideComponentId 799883f5-7962-4384-a10a-105adaec6ffc --listType List
```

Retrieve a ListView Command Set by its title:

```sh
m365 spo tenant commandset get --title "Some customizer"
```

Retrieve a list of tenant-wide deployed ListView Command Sets:

```sh
m365 spo tenant commandset list
```

### Introducing our New Website with Docusaurus ðŸ¦–

We're thrilled to announce that we've given our website a long-awaited makeover! After much deliberation and development efforts, we've migrated to a new static site generator called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This transition has been a significant undertaking, involving extensive discussions and dedicated development time. The result? A refreshed and enhanced website experience that includes a sophisticated search engine powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

We can't wait to hear your thoughts and feedback on our new website! Feel free to share your experience and leave us a comment on [Discord](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/discord). We value your input and look forward to continuously improving our online presence based on your valuable insights.

### Embracing the Power of async/await in our Codebase

We're excited to unveil a major undertaking that has consumed our efforts for quite some time: the refactoring of our codebase to embrace the asynchronous programming model using **async/await**. This change marks a milestone in our journey, as it makes our code more readable and easier to work with.

With the groundwork already laid by refactoring the core aspects of our commands, we are now changing all remaining promises to achieve a fully async/await codebase. This process ensures that our commands operate seamlessly, taking full advantage of the benefits offered by async/await. This refactoring demonstrates the remarkable power of community and the cherished principle of `sharing is caring`, as it has involved an immense amount of work accomplished within a relatively short span of time.

We're thrilled to present you with an improved experience that harnesses the power of asynchronous programming. [Stay tuned](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/issues/3618) as we continue to refine and optimize our codebase, delivering even greater efficiency and readability to our valued users.

### Filter Flows by Sharing Status with 'flow list' Command

We're thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement to our widely used `m365 flow list` command. Now, you have the ability to filter the list of flows based on their sharing status, providing you with greater control and flexibility. You can now refine your flow list using the following sharing statuses:

- `ownedByMe`: Retrieves all flows created by you, regardless of whether they are shared or not.
- `personal`: Displays flows created by you that are not shared with others.
- `sharedWithMe`: Presents flows that are shared with you or those created by you and shared with someone else.
- `all`: Combines both personal and sharedWithMe categories to provide a comprehensive list of flows.

To utilize this powerful feature, simply include the `--sharingStatus` option followed by the desired sharing status value when executing the `m365 flow list` command. For example:

```sh
m365 flow list --environmentName Default-d87a7535-dd31-4437-bfe1-95340acd55c5 --sharingStatus personal --includeSolutions
```
