> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) to discover an array of exciting features and improvements that will revolutionize your Microsoft 365 journey.

## What's new

### New search command

Nowadays searching for the right information is a fundamental action that many times is an initial point to flows, scripts, or our day-to-day tasks. That is why we introduced a new `m365 search` command that is at the very root of our command hierarchy. It leverages Mircosoft Graph search capabilities to retrieve information about almost any Microsoft 365 area.

To search for all sites you may simply run:

```sh
m365 search --scopes 'site' --queryText 'site:\"https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/*\"'
```

To query list items and sites that contain the string "accountt" and request a spelling modification for the query, just use:

```sh
m365 search --scopes 'listItem, site' --queryText 'accountt' --enableSpellingSuggestion --enableSpellingModification
```

To search for file report.xlsl in a specific folder of user's personal OneDrive you may run the following:

```sh
m365 search --scopes 'driveItem' --queryText 'filename:report.xlsl AND path:\"https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/john.doe_contoso_com/Documents/Reports/2024\"'
```

- [m365 search](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/search/)

### New Viva Engage command

We took the first steps in introducing commands that will allow you to manage your Viva Engage communities. We added a `get` command to retrieve details about a specific community.

To get a specific community by ID, simply run:

```sh
m365 viva engage community get --id eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI0Mjg1NzkwNjE3NyJ9
```

- [m365 viva engage community get](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/viva/engage/engage-community-get/)

### New SharePoint command

Do you know what's better than removing list items from a SharePoint list? Removing them in a batch! In this release, we added a command that will help you be more effective in exactly that.

To remove a list of IDs from a list with a csv run:

```sh
m365 spo listitem batch remove --filePath ./IDlist.csv --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project-x --listTitle "Demo List"
```

For more information, check the following resources:
- [m365 spo listitem batch remove](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/listitem/listitem-batch-remove/)

### New Microsoft Entra ID group commands

In this release, we introduced new Entra ID commands that allow you to update the roles of single or multiple users and a new command that retrieves all groups of which the user is a member of. Let's check them out in action.

To update a single user specified by UPN to an owner of a group, simply run:

```sh
m365 entra group user set --groupDisplayName Developers --userNames john.doe@contoso.com --role Owner
```

To update multiple users specified by UPN to owners of a group, you may run the following:

```sh
m365 entra group user set --groupId a03c0c35-ef9a-419b-8cab-f89e0a8d2d2a --userNames "john.doe@contoso.com,adele.vance@contoso.com" --role Owner
```

To retrieve groups where the currently logged-in user is a member of, just run the following:

```sh
m365 entra user groupmembership list --userName '@meUserName'
```

For more information check the following resources:
- [m365 entra group user set](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/group/group-user-set/)
- [m365 entra user groupmembership list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/user/user-groupmembership-list/)

Right now, there are over 50 opened PRs with new awesome features that will soon be added to CLI for Microsoft 365, and [58 issues that are up for grabs](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
