Introducing the latest release of CLI for Microsoft 365

[CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) is a cross-platform command line tool based on Node.js that helps you manage many things around Microsoft 365 and your SPFx project. You may manage OneDrive, Planner, Power Apps and Automate, Teams, Yammer, SharePoint (of course), and many many more. The list keeps on growing and growing. In this minor release, we introduced new commands as well as a tonne of improvements.

> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) to discover an array of exciting features and improvements that will revolutionize your Microsoft 365 journey.

## What's new

In this minor release, we added a couple of new commands and enhancements to the existing functionality. Check out some of the awesome stuff added and be sure to try them out.

### Power Apps Management

We've introduced a new command that allows you to list all permissions of a Power App as well as an additional command to modify the app owner. Check out the details below:

To lists all permissions of a Power App, simply run:

```sh
m365 pa app permission list --appName bc9f0a7e-53df-46af-b669-5888bb2f63d0
```

You may also filter the results to only a given role by doing:

```sh
m365 pa app permission list --appName bc9f0a7e-53df-46af-b669-5888bb2f63d0 --roleName CanEdit
```

In order to set a new owner for a Power App and remove the previous owner, all you need to do is:

```sh
m365 pa app owner set --environmentName Default-716eb9fb-bf79-4be9-b0c7-900824fcbe25 --appName 7ab97923-4a4d-4467-b030-12071d2b810b --userName john.doe@contoso.com
```

- [m365 pa app permission list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/pa/app/app-permission-list/)

### Teams Management

Microsoft Teams has become a collaboration platform of its own and for many of us, working remotely or not, it is the first start-up tool when starting your working day. With CLI for Microsoft 365 we try to extend the capabilities of what you may manage around that product. In this release, we introduce a command which allows you to add a member to a Microsoft Teams chat conversation

To add a member by UPN to a Teams chat and share chat history until a specific point in time, simply run:

```sh
m365 teams chat member add --chatId 19:8b081ef6-4792-4def-b2c9-c363a1bf41d5_5031bb31-22c0-4f6f-9f73-91d34ab2b32d@unq.gbl.spaces --userName john.doe@contoso.com --visibleHistoryStartDateTime 2023-05-03T12:00:00Z
```

### SharePoint Framework Projects v1.18.0-beta.1 Support

If you want to keep up to date with the latest SPFx enhancements you are going to love our latest update. In this release, we added the support for SPFx `v1.18.0-beta.1` to three of our most popular commands: `spfx project upgrade`, `spfx project doctor`, and `spfx doctor`.

Here are the commands to get you started:

```sh
m365 spfx project upgrade --output md
```

```sh
m365 spfx doctor --output text
```

```sh
m365 spfx project doctor --output md
```

For more information, check out the documentation for each command:

- [spfx project upgrade](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spfx/project/project-upgrade/)
- [spfx doctor](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spfx/spfx-doctor/)
- [spfx project doctor](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spfx/project/project-doctor/)

### Extended Planner commands with rosters support

Not so long ago we introduced Planner Roster commands and now we refactored the already existing commands to add that support there as well. In this minor release, we modified the planner bucket commands with the ability to reference Planner Rosters. Check out the [related issue](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/issues/4820) to find out more.

### The fun never stops, improving our Codebase

In this minor release, we continue our work on refactoring the code base to embrace the asynchronous programming model using **async/await**. All this would not have been possible without our awesome contributors and their dedication to CLI for Microsoft 365. Just have a look at the [list](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/issues/3618) to get a feeling of the amount of work already done and what is left.

We've also taken the first steps to refactor our codebase to centralize the shared code in util functions. This refactor will bring a performance boost to the tool as well as allows easier integration and testing. Check out the [related issue](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/issues/4531) to go over the details.
