We have just published a new minor version of CLI for Microsoft 365. [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to manage your Microsoft 365 tenant and SharePoint Framework projects. This minor release introduces several new commands that will enhance the quality of your Microsoft 365 experience.

> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) to discover various exciting features and improvements that will revolutionize your Microsoft 365 journey. 

## What's New

### File Management Enhancements

#### Move Files with Ease

We’ve introduced the `file move` command, allowing you to move files to a new location using the Microsoft Graph API. This is a powerful addition for those who frequently reorganize content within their SharePoint environments.

### Limitations

- When moving files within the same document library or drive, the command uses the Move DriveItem API, which preserves the file's version history.
- When moving files between different document libraries or drives, the command performs a copy-and-delete operation. In this scenario, the version history will not be retained.

Here’s how you can move a file:

```sh
m365 file move --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project --sourceUrl "/sites/project/Shared Documents/Document.pdf" --targetUrl "/sites/IT/Shared Documents"
```

For more details, visit [file move](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/file/file-move/).

### Power Automate Management

#### Manage Recycle Bin Items

Managing soft-deleted flows just got simpler! The new commands for Power Automate allow you to list and restore flows from the recycle bin.

List all soft-deleted flows:

```sh
m365 flow recyclebinitem list --environmentName Default-d87a7535-dd31-4437-bfe1-95340acd55c5
```

Restore a soft-deleted flow:

```sh
m365 flow recyclebinitem restore --environmentName Default-d87a7535-dd31-4437-bfe1-95340acd55c5 --flowName 5923cb07-ce1a-4a5c-ab81-257ce820109a
```

Explore more at [flow recyclebinitem list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/flow/recyclebinitem/recyclebinitem-list/) and [flow recyclebinitem restore](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/flow/recyclebinitem/recyclebinitem-restore/).

### SharePoint Management

#### Streamlined Folder Sharing

We’ve expanded SharePoint commands to include new options for managing folder-sharing links. Now, you can easily create, remove, or clear all sharing links associated with a folder.

Create a new sharing link for a folder:

```sh
m365 spo folder sharinglink add --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demo --folderUrl /sites/demo/shared%20documents/Folder --type view --scope anonymous
```

Remove all sharing links from a folder:

```sh
m365 spo folder sharinglink clear --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demo --folderUrl '/sites/demo/Shared Documents/folder1'
```

Remove a specific sharing link from a folder:

```sh
m365 spo folder sharinglink remove --webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demo --folderUrl /sites/demo/shared%20documents/Folder --id c391b57d-5783-4c53-9236-cefb5c6ef323
```

- [m365 spo folder sharinglink add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/folder/folder-sharinglink-add/)
- [m365 spo folder sharinglink clear](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/folder/folder-sharinglink-clear/)
- [m365 spo folder sharinglink remove](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/folder/folder-sharinglink-remove/)

#### Advanced Site Administration

Adding and removing site collection administrators is now more efficient with our new commands. Plus, you can now set sharing permissions for a site collection directly from the CLI.

Add a group as a secondary site collection administrator:

```sh
m365 spo site admin add --siteUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com --groupName SP_Administrators --asAdmin
```

Remove a user as site collection admin:

```sh
m365 spo site admin remove --siteUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com --userId 600713c5-53c6-4f24-b454-3c35e22b2639
```

Update the sharing permissions for a site so only owners can share files and the site:

```sh
m365 spo site sharingpermission set --siteUrl https://siteaddress.com/sites/sitename --capability ownersOnly
```

For more information check the following resources:
- [m365 spo site admin add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/site/site-admin-add/)
- [m365 spo site admin remove](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/site/site-admin-remove/)
- [m365 spo site sharingpermission set](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/site/site-sharingpermission-set/)

### SharePoint Premium

We’re excited to introduce commands to list SharePoint Premium content centers, helping you manage these advanced services more effectively.

Get information about the SharePoint Premium content centers:

```sh
m365 spp contentcenter list
```

### Microsoft Teams

We're not stopping there! We've also added a new command to download a transcript for a given meeting. This is a great addition for those who want to keep a record of their meeting conversations.

Save a transcript for a specific meeting:

```sh
m365 teams meeting transcript get --userName garthf@contoso.com --meetingId MSo1N2Y5ZGFjYy03MWJmLTQ3NDMtYjQxMy01M2EdFGkdRWHJlQ --id MSMjMCMjNzU3ODc2ZDYtOTcwMi00MDhkLWFkNDItOTE2ZDNmZjkwZGY4 --outputFile c:/Transcript.vtt
```
