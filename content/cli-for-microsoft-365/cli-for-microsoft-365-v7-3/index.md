Introducing the latest release of CLI for Microsoft 365

[CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to manage your Microsoft 365 tenant and SharePoint Framework projects. This minor release introduces a number of new administrative commands as well as a ton of awesome improvements.

> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) to discover an array of exciting features and improvements that will revolutionize your Microsoft 365 journey.

## What's new

### Microsoft Entra ID

In the last release, we introduced a series of commands that allow you to manage administrative units. An administrative unit is a Microsoft Entra resource that can be a container for other Microsoft Entra resources. It may contain users, groups and devices. In this new release, we're adding new commands to manage the members of these administrative units.

To retrieve a list of all members of a specified administrative unit

```sh
m365 aad administrativeunit member list --administrativeUnitName 'Marketing Division'
```

To retrieve a list of users that are part of a specified administrative unit

```sh
m365 aad administrativeunit member list --administrativeUnitName 'Marketing Division' --type user
```

To add a user to an administrative unit

```sh
m365 aad administrativeunit member add --administrativeUnitName 'Marketing Division' --userName john.doe@contoso.com
```

To add an Entra Group to an administrative unit

```sh
m365 aad administrativeunit member add --administrativeUnitName 'Marketing Division' --groupName 'Marketing Group'
```

To get information about a single user that's a member of an administrative unit

```sh
m365 aad administrativeunit member get --id 64131a70-beb9-4ccb-b590-4401e58446ec --administrativeUnitName 'Marketing Division'
```

We've also added a new command around permission management. An area that the CLI for Microsoft 365 shines in. While we already supported managing delegated and application permissions on enterprise applications, managing permissions of App Registrations was not fully covered. This release brings a new command to achieve that purpose.

Grant multiple delegated API permissions to an Entra ID (Azure AD) app specified by client id

```sh
m365 aad app permission add --appId 'f1417aa3-bf0b-4cc5-a845-a0b2cf11f690' --delegatedPermissions 'https://management.azure.com/user_impersonation https://service.flow.microsoft.com/Flows.Read.All https://graph.microsoft.com/Agreement.Read.All'
```

### External content

The release of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 brings new challenges and possibilities in surfacing your data to your users. As an aid in this field, Graph connectors can be a significant asset to get line of business data into Microsoft 365 and allow Copilot to work with it. The CLI for Microsoft 365 has a growing group of commands that allow you to work with Graph connectors.
This release brings a new command to add new items to a connector and a new doctor command to verify if your external connection is correctly configured.

To add a new item to an external connection, with simple properties that everyone is allowed to access

```sh
m365 external item add --id "pnp-ensure-siteassets-library" --connectionId "samplesolutiongallery" --content "Ensure that the Site Assets library is created." --title "Ensure the Site Assets Library is created" --description "Ensure that the Site Assets library is created." --authors "Phil Harding" --acls "grant,everyone,everyone"
```

To check if an external connection is correctly configured for use with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

```sh
m365 external connection doctor --id contosoproducts --ux copilot
```

For more information check the following resources:
- [m365 external connection doctor](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/external/connection/connection-doctor)
- [m365 external item add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/external/item/item-add)

### Microsoft Teams

This release also brings a new command to create new meetings in Microsoft Teams. This can be useful in automation scenarios where creating meetings on the fly brings an advantage. But it can also be used from the terminal interactively by those who love the speed of terminal interactions and often have one available.

To create a new online meeting for the currently logged-in user, starting immediately and ending after one hour, run

```sh
m365 teams meeting add
```

To create a new online meeting for the currently logged-in user, with a specified subject and a list of participants, run

```sh
m365 teams meeting add --subject "Test Subject" --participantUserNames "john.doe@contoso.com,olga.manager@contoso.com"
```

To create a new online meeting from an automated app-only process, using a selected organizer and have Microsoft Teams record the meeting automatically

```sh
m365 teams meeting add --organizerEmail "john.doe@contoso.com" --subject "Test Subject" --participantUserNames "olga.manager@contoso.com" --recordAutomatically
```
