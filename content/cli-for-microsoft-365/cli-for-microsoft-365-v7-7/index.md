## What's new

### New Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management commands

Microsoft Entra [Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) is a service in Microsoft Entra ID that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. These resources include resources in Microsoft Entra ID, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.

This release of [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) includes the introduction of the Privileged Identity Management (PIM) commands that allow you to manage the PIM settings for users and groups in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

For requesting activation of an Entra role assignment for a **user** or **group**, run:

```sh
m365 entra pim role assignment add --roleDefinitionName 'SharePoint Administrator'
```

For retrieving list of Entra role assignments for a **user** or **group**, run:

```sh

### New SharePoint Embedded Container Commands

[Microsoft SharePoint Embedded](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/embedded/overview) is a cloud-based file and document management system suitable for use in any application. SharePoint Embedded is a new API-only solution that enables app developers to harness the power of the Microsoft 365 file and document storage platform for any app, and is suitable for enterprises building line-of-business applications and ISVs building multitenant applications.

This release of [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) includes introduction of SharePoint Embedded (SPE) container commands which will have various commands which will help you to manage your containers.

To create a new Container Type for your app, run:

```sh
m365 spo contenttype sync —webUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sales --id 0x01007926A45D687BA842B947286090B8F67D
