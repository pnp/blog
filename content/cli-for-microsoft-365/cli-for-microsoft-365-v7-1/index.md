## What's new

### Azure Active Directory

With this release, we've introduced a new command that allows you to list users of a specific Azure AD group. This command is a great addition to your arsenal, as it provides you with greater control and flexibility when managing your Azure AD groups.

List all group users from a group specified by ID.

```sh
m365 aad group user list --groupId 03cba9da-3974-46c1-afaf-79caa2e45bbe
```

List all group users from a group specified by name. For each one return the display name, e-mail address, and manager display name.

```sh
m365 aad group user list --groupDisplayName Developers --properties "displayName,mail,manager/displayName"
```

List all group members that are guest users.

```sh
m365 aad group user list --groupDisplayName Developers --filter "userType eq 'Guest'"
```
