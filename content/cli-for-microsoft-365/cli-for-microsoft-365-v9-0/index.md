We have just published a new major version of CLI for Microsoft 365 v9. [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to manage your Microsoft 365 tenant and SharePoint Framework projects. This major release introduces several new commands that will enhance the quality of your Microsoft 365 experience as well as a breaking change in the default login experience.

> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) to discover an array of exciting features and improvements that will revolutionize your Microsoft 365 journey. 
 
## The new major version of CLI for Microsoft 365 – v9

This major release is a reaction to an announcement that the PnP Management Shell multi-tenant app will be removed on September 9. Previously you were able to use this app to grant the needed permissions for your scripts or standard usage of CLI for Microsoft 365. Till now it was even used as the default login method. The removal of this approach might have an impact on your existing scripts. Check the following [blog post for more details](https://pnp.github.io/blog/post/changes-pnp-management-shell-registration/) on this announcement. Although using the PnP Management Shell was very convenient it wasn't the best approach that should be picked especially when running automated scripts on your tenant. This option will now go away to help customers to improve their security posture by encouraging the use of single-tenant app and just the scopes and permissions that are needed. CLI for Microsoft 365 already supports login over your own Entra app registration and we already have [guidance that will guide you through the process](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/using-own-identity). In this release, we introduced some features that might prove very helpful in adapting to this change.

The most important change that had to be done was the way CLI for Microsoft 365 will perform default login. When running `m365 login` CLI will first check if you defined the `appId` which is now required for your own single-tenant Microsoft Entra app registration. 

This may be either passed as the option like 

```sh
m365 login --appId 31359c7f-bd7e-475c-86db-fdb8c937548c --tenant 31359c7f-bd7e-475c-86db-fdb8c937548a
```

Or you may also define it as a CLI for Microsoft 365 config using the following command by running

```sh
m365 cli config set --key 'clientId' --value '31359c7f-bd7e-475c-86db-fdb8c937548e'
```

You may also define it as an environment variable `CLIMICROSOFT365_ENTRAAPPID` and you may find more details regarding this option in our [guide](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/using-own-identity#create-environment-variables). 

This means that you will now need to set up your own Entra app registration before performing the initial login. You may do that in several ways. Either by doing it manually and we also included detailed [step by step documentation for that](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/using-own-identity#register-microsoft-entra-application-in-your-tenant) or you may use our new `setup` experience which will make this process effortless. 
By the way, this tip you may also find when running the `m365 login` command without specifying the `appId`. 

![m365-login-tip](./images/m365-login-tip.png)

The m365 setup command is a wizard that helps you configure the CLI for Microsoft 365 for your needs. It will ask you a series of questions and based on your answers, it will configure the CLI for Microsoft 365 for you and now it will also help you create your own Microsoft Entra app registration in a matter of seconds.

When running:

```sh
m365 setup
```

CLI will now ask you an additional question:

- CLI for Microsoft 365 requires a Microsoft Entra app. Do you want to create a new app registration or use an existing one?

You can choose between using an existing Entra app or creating a new one. If you choose to create a new app, CLI will ask you to choose between a minimal and a full set of permissions. 
A minimal set of permissions will create a new Entra app registration with only `User.Read` scope. This is a perfect starting point to have a ready to use app that then you may manually modify to add only the needed scopes for your script. 
Full set of permissions, on the other hand, will create an Entra app registration with all the scopes currently required to run all commands CLI for Microsoft 365 has. This is very convenient and is the easiest thing to pick to get unblocked with all CLI functionalities.
Whats important to now is that the `setup` command signs in as Azure CLI to your tenant to create a new app registration, and stores its information in the CLI configuration so that then you don't need to specify them yourself in the `login` command. Check out how easy and convenient it is in this short demo:

## What else is new

### New command to remove Entra enterprise application

We already have commands that allow you to query and even add a new Entra enterprise application. Now, we have extended this area with a brand new command that will allow you to clean up by removing the unneeded enterprise application. It is extra convenient to use.

To delete an enterprise application by display name run:

```sh
m365 entra enterpriseapp remove --displayName "Contoso app"
```

You may also do the same either by specifying application ID:

```sh
m365 entra enterpriseapp remove --id b2307a39-e878-458b-bc90-03bc578531d6
```

Or object ID: 

```sh
m365 entra enterpriseapp remove --objectId b2307a39-e878-458b-bc90-03bc578531dd
```

```

```

### Restore a deleted message from a channel in a Team with ease

Teams commands were always an important part of CLI for Microsoft 365 and in this release, we added a brand new command that will allow you to restore a deleted message from a channel.

You may do that either by specifying everything by IDs:

```sh
m365 teams message restore --teamId 5f5d7b71-1161-44d8-bcc1-3da710eb4171 --channelId 19:4a95f7d8db4c4e7fae857bcebe0623e6@thread.tacv2 --id 1540747442203
```

```

## What's changed

Besides all these new commands, we've also made some changes to some existing commands. A few bugs have been fixed and the codebase has been polished. Changes include an enhancement to the way we may [activate the specified Microsoft 365 tenant connection](#Enhacemenets-to-connection-use-command).

### Enhancements to connection use command

One of the biggest advantages of the CLI for Microsoft 365 is that it is able to connect to multiple accounts (tenants) and switch connections when needed instead of having to log in and out every time. In this release, we enhanced the `connection use` command in a way that it will present you a prompt with a list of all your connections so it is super easy to just pick the correct one and perform the switch.
