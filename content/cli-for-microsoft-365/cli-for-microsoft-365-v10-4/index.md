It's that time of the month again! We've just published a new minor version of the CLI for Microsoft 365. [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to manage your Microsoft 365 tenant and SharePoint Framework projects. This minor release introduces new commands that will enhance the quality of your Microsoft 365 experience.

> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) for a neat overview of all the exciting features and improvements. 

## What's New

### Microsoft Entra ID

In this release, we added two new commands for working with Microsoft Entra ID. You can now revoke sign-in sessions for a given user. Something that may be necessary when certain security events take place where resetting a user's password may not be enough. 
We've also added an additional command for working with custom role definitions. When creating custom role definitions you'll need to know what resources actions are available. These resource actions, also called role permissions, are categorized in namespaces. We've added a command to list these namespaces, making it easier to find the correct resource actions.

To get a list of resource namespaces, run:

```sh
m365 entra resourcenamespace list
```

To revoke sign-in sessions for a given user, run:

```sh
m365 entra user session revoke --userName john.doe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```

- [m365 entra user session revoke](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/user/user-session-revoke/)

### Outlook

In the previous release, we added a command to update Outlook mailbox settings. In this release, we're adding the command to retrieve these settings for a mailbox.

To get the mailbox settings of the signed-in user, run:

```sh
m365 outlook mailbox settings get
```

To get the mailbox settings of a given user, run:

```sh
m365 outlook mailbox settings get --userName john.doe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```

- [m365 outlook mailbox settings get](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/outlook/mailbox/mailbox-settings-get)

### Tenant report settings

We also added a new command that allows you to retrieve report settings for an organization.

To get the tenant-level settings for Microsoft 365 reports, use:

```sh
m365 tenant report settings get
```

- [m365 tenant report settings get](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/tenant/report/report-settings-get/)

## What's changed

This release also brings several enhancements and bug fixes to elevate the overall CLI experience. For instance we've aligned some option names and did a lot of other housekeeping.

### New sample script - Finding obsolete Microsoft 365 groups with PowerShell

We've also added a sample about getting a report of possibly unused Microsoft 365 groups. The sample script uses the CLI for Microsoft 365 to gather insights about SharePoint file activity within the SharePoint site connected to the Microsoft 365 group. It also checks the age of email conversations in the group mailbox. And lastly it checks the amount of people (group owners, members and guests) in the group. The script generates a report based on these statistics that can help us understand what groups are possibly obsolete.
