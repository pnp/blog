### Enhancing the User Experience, One Step at a Time

We're always looking for ways to make your experience even better. That's why we're thrilled to announce our latest initiative to enhance the user experience, starting with an update to our help headings. 

We know that when it comes to navigating commands, every little detail counts. That's why we've taken the first step in our journey to improve UX by formatting all help headings as bold and uppercase in the terminal. Here is a preview of what this change looks like:

![Example of the help out within the CLI for Microsoft 365](./images/help-formatting.png)

This update will not only make it easier to read and find the information you need, but it will also add a touch of style to your terminal window. So, whether you're a power user or a beginner, you can now enjoy an even more seamless and visually appealing experience when using our commands. Keep an eye out for more UX enhancements on the horizon - we're just getting started!

### Revamped output types for a more dynamic experience

We've revamped the `csv` and `markdown (md)` output types to give you even more control over your command results. 

With the extended `csv` output mode, you can now view more properties than ever before, making it easier to analyze your data and draw insights. But that's not all - we've also introduced a new default behavior for nested objects. 

Now, nested objects are excluded by default for both `csv` and `markdown (md)` outputs. However, if you need to retrieve specific properties from nested objects, you can use the `--query` JMESPath option to force a selection of properties. This update ensures that you get exactly what you need from your command results, without the clutter.

### And much **MUCH** more ...

We've enhanced a bunch of commands and squashed a bunch of pesky bugs to bring you a more dynamic and seamless experience than ever before. 

But don't just take our word for it - check out the release notes below to see the full list of enhancements and bug fixes. From added options to enhanced commands, our latest release has it all.
