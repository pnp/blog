The CLI for Microsoft 365 strikes again! We've just published a new minor version of the CLI for Microsoft 365. [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365) is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to manage your Microsoft 365 tenant and SharePoint Framework projects. This minor release introduces new commands that will enhance the quality of your Microsoft 365 experience.

> Explore the [release notes](https://aka.ms/cli-m365/notes) for a neat overview of all the exciting features and improvements. 

## What's New

### Microsoft Graph

In this release, we’ve added new commands to improve how you interact with Microsoft Graph and Entra ID. You now have more flexibility when working with directory and open extensions, which allow you to store custom data for various resources like users and groups. This will help you manage and enrich your environment in a more streamlined way.

To get all directory extensions registered for an application specified by name, run:

```sh
m365 graph directoryextension list --appName ContosoApp
```

To update an open extension for a user specified by UPN, run:

```sh
m365 graph openextension set --userName john.doe@contoso.com --name 'com.contoso.roamingSettings' --resourceType user --theme dark --color red --language English
```

- [graph openextension set](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/graph/openextension/openextension-set/)


### Microsoft Entra ID

A feature has been added to retrieve and manage a list of organizations within your Entra ID environment, simplifying administrative tasks.

To retrieve all your organizations, simply run:

```sh
m365 entra organization list
```

- [m365 entra organization list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/entra/organization/organization-list/)

### SharePoint Embedded

New features for SharePoint Embedded enhance container management. You can now create and remove containers, view and manage permissions, and retrieve lists of deleted containers. These improvements offer more control over your SharePoint Embedded environments, making it easier to organize, maintain, and recover containers, ultimately improving your administrative workflows and efficiency.

To create a new container, run:

```sh
m365 spe container add --name Invoices --containerTypeName "Invoice app container type"
```

To remove a container, run:

```sh
m365 spe container remove --name "My Application Storage Container" --containerTypeName "My Application Container Type"
```

To list all permissions for a specific container, run:

```sh
m365 spe container permission list --containerId "b!ISJs1WRro0y0EWgkUYcktDa0mE8zSlFEqFzqRn70Zwp1CEtDEBZgQICPkRbil_5Z"
```

To list all deleted containers in a specific type, run:

```sh
m365 spe container recyclebinitem list --containerTypeName "My container type name"
```

To remove a container type, run:

```sh
m365 spe containertype remove --name 'My container type'
```

For more information, check the following resources:
- [spe container add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spe/container/container-add/)
- [spe container remove](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spe/container/container-remove/)

### SharePoint Premium

We’ve introduced a new command to manage SharePoint Premium features, allowing you to easily apply trained document understanding models to document libraries. This feature is particularly useful for organizations looking to enhance their document processing capabilities by leveraging AI-driven insights.

To apply a trained model to a document library, run:

```sh
m365 spp model apply --webUrl "https://contoso.sharepoint.com" --contentCenterUrl "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/ContentCenter" --title "ModelExample" --listTitle "Shared Documents"
```

## What's changed

This release also brings some other great changes. Aside from many improvements in the codebase and bug fixes to elevate the overall CLI experience, there are a couple of things we'd like to highlight.

### Support for SharePoint Framework v1.21.1

Support for SPFx 1.21.1 has been added, ensuring compatibility with the latest version of the SharePoint Framework. This update allows you to take full advantage of the new features and improvements in SPFx 1.21.1, enhancing your development experience and enabling you to build more efficient and modern SharePoint solutions.

### Federated Identity Login for Azure DevOps

A new feature has been added to support federated identity login when running in Azure DevOps, allowing you to deploy apps without the need for certificates in your CI/CD pipeline. This provides a more streamlined and secure authentication process, enabling easier integration and automation of your Microsoft 365 workflows directly within Azure DevOps. Whether you're using a service connection or not, you can now authenticate with federated identity, simplifying the overall deployment process and enhancing security across your workflows.

### Refactorings & improvements

We’ve made several refactorings and improvements to enhance the performance and usability of existing commands, ensuring a smoother experience when managing teams, sites, and Viva Connections. Additionally, as part of our ongoing effort to improve reliability, we’ve migrated several commands to Zod, a powerful data validation library. This migration enhances the accuracy, stability, and overall performance of the CLI, making it easier to accomplish tasks with greater ease.

## Upcoming Changes
