Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices (PnP) Community June 2021 update is
out with a summary of the latest guidance, samples, and solutions from
Microsoft or from the community for the community. This article is a
summary of all the different areas and topics around the community work
we do around Microsoft 365 ecosystem during the past month. Thank you
for being part of this success. *Sharing is caring!*

## What is Microsoft 365 Community (PnP)

[Microsoft 365 PnP](https://aka.ms/m365pnp) is a nick-name for Microsoft
365 platform community activities coordinated by numerous teams inside
of the Microsoft 365 engineering organizations. PnP is a
community-driven open source initiative where Microsoft and external
community members are sharing their learning's around implementation
practices for Microsoft 365.
Topics vary from Microsoft Viva, Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Teams,
OneDrive and SharePoint. Active development and contributions happen in
GitHub by providing contributions to the samples, reusable components,
and documentation for different areas. PnP is owned and coordinated by
Microsoft engineering, but this is work done by the community for the
community.

-   See more details from [New Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices
    (PnP) team model with new community
    leads](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blogs/new-microsoft-365-patterns-and-practices-pnp-team-model-with-new-community-leads/)
The initiative is facilitated by Microsoft, but we have multiple
community members as part of the PnP team (see team details in end of
the article) and we are always looking to extend the PnP team with more
community members. Notice that since this is open source community
initiative, so there's no SLAs for the support for the samples provided
through GitHub. Obviously, all officially released components and
libraries are under official support from Microsoft.

## What's supportability story around the community tooling and assets?

Following statements apply across all of the community lead and
contributed samples and solutions, including samples, core component(s)
and solutions, like [SharePoint Starter
Kit](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit), [yo
teams](https://aka.ms/yoteams) or [PnP
PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps).
All Microsoft released SDKs and tools are supported based on the
specific tool policies.


-   PnP guidance and samples are created by Microsoft & by the Community

-   PnP guidance and samples are maintained by Microsoft & community
-   PnP uses supported and recommended techniques
-   PnP is an open-source initiative by the community -- people who work
    on the initiative for the benefit of others, have their normal day
    job as well
-   PnP is NOT a product and therefore it's not supported by Premier
    Support or other official support channels
-   PnP is supported in similar ways as other open source projects done
    by Microsoft with support from the community by the community
-   There are numerous partners that utilize PnP within their solutions
    for customers. Support for this is provided by the Partner. When PnP
    material is used in deployments, we recommend being clear with your
    customer/deployment owner on the support model
Please see the specifics on the supportability on the tool, SDK or 
component repository or download page.


## Microsoft 365 PnP team model


![pnp-community-model.png](images/pnp-community-model.png)

In April 2020 we announced our new [Microsoft 365 PnP team
model](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blogs/new-microsoft-365-patterns-and-practices-pnp-team-model-with-new-community-leads/)
and grew the MVP team quite significantly. PnP model exists for having
more efficient engagement between Microsoft engineering and community
members. Let's build things together. Your contributions and feedback
is always welcome! During August, we also crew the team with 5 new
members. PnP Team coordinates and leads the different open-source and
community efforts we execute in the Microsoft 365 platform.
We welcome all community members to get involved on the community and
open-source efforts. Your input do matter!

## Area-specific updates

These are different areas which are closely involved on the community
work across the PnP initiative. Some are lead and coordinated by
engineering organizations, some are coordinated by the community and
MVPs.


### Microsoft Graph Toolkit

![graph-toolkit.jpg](images/graph-toolkit.jpg)


Microsoft Graph Toolkit is engineering lead initiative, which works
closely with the community on the open-source areas. The Microsoft Graph
Toolkit is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic web components
and helpers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The
components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in
providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.



-   Latest version currently is 2.2. See the v2.2 announcement blog post
    for more details - [Announcing new file components, MSAL 2 Provider,
    and SharePoint Framework library in Microsoft
    Graph\...](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/announcing-new-file-components-msal-2-provider-and-sharepoint-framework-library-in-microsoft-graph-toolkit/)

### Microsoft 365 Community docs


![community-dcos.png](images/community-dcos.png)

Community docs model was announced in the April 2020 and it's great to
see the interest for community to help each other by providing new
guidance on the non-dev areas. See more on the announcement from the
SharePoint blog - [Announcing the Microsoft 365 Community
Docs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/announcing-the-microsoft-365-community-docs/ba-p/1288203).
We do welcome contributions from the community - our objective is to
build a valuable location for articles from Microsoft and community
together.

Have ideas for articles or want to contribute yourself? - Get involved!

**Companies:** 

Here's the companies, which provided support the
community initiative for this month by allowing their employees working
for the benefit of others in the community. There were also people who
contributed from other companies during last month, but we did not get
their logos and approval to show them in time for these communications.
If you still want your logo for this month's release, please let us
know and share the logo with us. Thx.
