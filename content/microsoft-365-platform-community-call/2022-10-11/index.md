### Demos

* **Introduction to Records Management APIs on Microsoft Graph** – automating Security, Compliance, Identity and Management (SCIM) with new Microsoft Graph APIs focusing on Records Management (RM), specifically Retention Labels, Events, and Event Types. Records Management and Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) helps organizations manage retention and deletion of data throughout its entire lifecycle. Use cases covered – events-based retention and label management for managing retention schedules. See sample queries in Postman. APIs currently in beta.
* **Build your first Command bot for Microsoft Teams with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** – Command bots automate repetitive tasks through a conversational interface, Teams Toolkit expedites the creation of command bots, and TeamsFX provides a layer of abstraction that simplifies working with bot framework. Create a command bot using Teams Toolkit, look at what was scaffolded, see Adaptive Cards in UI and then go deep into the code to understand implementation. Add command bots to a team, chat or meeting.
