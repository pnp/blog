### Demos

* **Migrate your SharePoint workflows to Power Automate with migration tooling (preview)** – a new feature working on top of SharePoint Migration tool that automates the migration of legacy (classic) SharePoint workflows to Power Automate. The tool queries the source workflow, converts to Power Automate flow, packages into a solution that’s published with Power Automate API. Owner reviews migrated flows, elects which to switch on. Details on 2 Previews – Public and Private (ends June 30). Step through migration.
* **TeamsJS SDK V2 to extend your Microsoft Teams solutions to Outlook and Office** – learn about recently announced enhancements (multi-host support, new namespaces, promises, new API calls, and backward compatibility) in the client-side SDK v2, along with concepts of capabilities and hosts. See how new capabilities can be queried, review several capability APIs, and then see capabilities in a demo of an app running in all 3 supported hosts. Code walkthrough and upgrade steps outlined.
* **Send a SMS message with Azure Communication Services** – it’s super easy to send an SMS message from ACS. Review 5 ACS core services, dive into the SMS service looking at 4 SMS use cases and at specific SMS features. Step through creating an ACS service in Azure Portal, creating a toll free number, adding the ACS package to project, adding a connection string to project, creating the SmsClient Object and calling Send().
