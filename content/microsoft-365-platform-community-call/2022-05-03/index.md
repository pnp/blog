### Demos

* **Extend your Microsoft Teams app to Outlook and Office.com** – using the
    same development tooling to expose a Teams app in 3 host environments.
    Here’s how. Download latest TeamsJS v2 SDK, open VS Code and run 2 commands
    to upgrade the Teams app package so the app will run in other hosts and to
    upgrade the SDK to point to TeamsJS v2.0. Done! Learn more about M365 cross
    stack tooling journey here and at Microsoft Build.
* **Introducing new M365 Assessment Tool with SharePoint Syntex Module** – an
    open-source assessment platform, for which additional modules can be built
    by Microsoft and Community. Uses CLI to run assessments tenant wide or on
    selected site collections. Step through tool download, usage and
    interpretation of Power BI report results. Replaces Modernization scanner.
    Effectively analyzes content stored in SharePoint and generates
    recommendations. In the case of Systex, the module identifies where Syntex
    could deliver highest impact.
* **Run Office Scripts with a button - now in Excel for Windows** – what are
    Office Scripts, the new script button, and how to get involved in the
    scripting journey. Scripts automate repetitive tasks and processes, and they
    are stored in your OneDrive for anywhere access by anyone with access to
    your workbook. Scripts are recorded and written in TypeScript/JavaScript.
    The new script button shown in demo is a first offering that works on Excel
    \- web and Windows.
