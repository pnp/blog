### Demos

* **Find meeting times for multiple people on Microsoft 365** – by adding very little code to your application. The simple capability allows schedulers to select attendees, meeting duration, and returns times all participants are available. Select a time, meeting subject and location. Press the Schedule meeting button, done. Same experience as in Outlook, but in your own app! Step through the code from Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Graph JavaScript SDK that enables this capability.
* **Introduction to new SharePoint Pages Microsoft Graph API** – new Microsoft Graph APIs to get, create and manage SharePoint pages (and news posts). Demos showing getting content from specific page, creating page, publishing page as news post, and deleting page. Target use cases, not in scope APIs, and roadmap for PnP/Graph SharePoint APIs called out. Beta API due out at end of November. Please Sign up to test the beta release.
* **Getting started with styling your Power Pages** – is a snap for Makers who can select colors, background images, layouts, etc. in the Pages workspace and choose themes (color palates), fonts, buttons, etc. in the Styling workspace. Makers can do all changes, no CSS, JavaScript or HTML. Developers may upload Bootstrap style sheets, apply styles across the board, apply brand colors directly, etc. working in CSS, JavaScript or HTML files in Visual Studio Code.
