### Demos

* **Taking advantage of the Microsoft Graph Postman collections** – in this 2nd installment, we look at 3 features demonstrating the integration between Postman and Graph Explorer. 1) Adding a request to a collection after getting request syntax from changelog or Graph Explorer, 2) using the collection runner to run a sequence of requests within a collection, 3) using Resources Explorer in Graph Explorer to find/export resources and import them (collection) to Postman.
* **Introduction on the Microsoft Viva Learning extensibility –** Viva Learning is bridging the divide between Learning systems and Work systems by exposing learning sources on the same surface employees are working. Learn about out-of-box integrations and Microsoft Graph APIs for syncing with content catalog and learner records. Viva Learning Graph APIs and roadmap include Content Sync API (Public preview) and Learner record (Assignment Sync and Completion Sync) APIs (Future preview).
* **Introduction to Virtual Appointment Microsoft Graph API** – a solution for business customers who have an existing scheduling system and Microsoft Teams, yet their customers do not have Teams installed on their mobiles or desktops. This virtual Teams call client builds on the existing onlineMeeting Graph API. Optimal for Business to Consumer (B2C) scenarios (telehealth, Interviews, video support, etc.) includes a virtual waiting room, SMS Appointment reminders and native browser join experience. In public preview.
