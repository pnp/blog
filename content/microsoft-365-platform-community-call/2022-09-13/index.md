### Demos

* **Microsoft Graph Postman - Scripts and advanced functionality** – Microsoft Graph has a collection on Postman. Focus for today’s call is Scripting in Postman – what is it (adding dynamic behavior to requests and collections), writing API tests, building requests that contain dynamic parameters, and passing data between requests. Demo shows how to find a specific Teams channel from a list of Microsoft Teams using scripts (pieces of JavaScript code) and about chaining execution requests.
* **Introduction to Microsoft Teams Toolkit** – a comprehensive walk through of Microsoft’s end-to-end approach to Teams app development that’s embodied in the structure of the Microsoft Teams Toolkit. Overview on core elements of the Teams Toolkit (CLI, VS Code, Visual Studio, SDK). Deep dive into layout and features (samples, scenario-based outcome templates, sandbox, etc.) of the VS Code extension that jump starts a developer’s integrated Teams development journey.
* **Introduction to app camp training package for Microsoft Teams ISVs** – App Camp is written for those who want to leverage (sell more) apps they’ve already built (web page, Webhooks, Bot, Web Service), in Microsoft Teams Store. Deliver Teams apps that appear in the UI and run anywhere but Teams! Guided labs use vanilla apps and supporting content to teach through example and to guide your app migration, without breaking your app!
