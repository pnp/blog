### Demos

* **Using dynamic SVG images with Viva ACEs for business charts** – here is a technique for generating/adding dynamic SVGs (interactive images) to Adaptive Card Extensions in a way that fits into the Adaptive Card mind-set (small, dynamic, performant). Run through code for adding a simple mathematically derived geometric graphic to a CardView and a more complex bar chart sample (image graphic bound to data) in a QuickView card. Follow this approach to create your own SVG generation functions.
* **Introduction to Microsoft Graph Developer Proxy** – a load test simulation tool in preview for Pro Developers building apps on top of Microsoft Graph. Learn what is the Microsoft Graph Developer Proxy, install and see it in action. The Dev Proxy generates issues/errors so you can see how your app that’s making requests to the Graph API reacts under load, with and without the Graph SDK. Please use the tool and provide feedback.
* **Introduction to Microsoft 365 App Compliance Automation Tool** – a service in Azure portal that simplifies the process of demonstrating security and compliance for applications published on Microsoft 365 by automating many (40%) of the validation processes, i.e., collecting and analyzing compliance data, generating compliance reports with prescriptive guidance. The compliance report integrates seamlessly into the Microsoft 365 Certification process in Partner Center. See creation of report in Azure portal, remediation, and integration in Partner Center.
