### Demos

* **Build Outlook Add-ins using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** – add-ins are a new feature in Toolkit v5. In this demo, install Toolkit preview, create a new Outlook task pane add-in (Preview on Windows). Initiate debugging, install prerequisites, walk through selected scaffolded folders and files. Observe manifest updates to support add-ins, env-dev folder, teamsapp.yaml files, and src files. Webpack runs project in background. Finally, run project locally in Outlook. Click buttons (actions) in e-mail to test.
* **Power Platform Solutions in Microsoft Teams – Example scenario deep dive** – moving beyond integration of Power Apps into Teams tabs or personal apps to implementations that utilize more Teams capabilities (action buttons, chat, adaptive cards) to deliver richer contextual conversations to your users. Sample incident reporting application in this demo showcases integration options - context aware apps, Power Apps deep linking, sharing (Power Automate Flow), all on desktop/mobile surfaces.
