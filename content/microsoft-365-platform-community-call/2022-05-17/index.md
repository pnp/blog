Once data is known, it can be found at Office.com, Teams, SharePoint, Bing at Work, etc. using Microsoft Search, Context IQ, and Search at Workplace. Link and content details typically rendered in sharable Adaptive Cards. Review Graph connector anatomy and core code to create connection, schema, externalItem, and add activities, for building your custom connector.
* **Your Microsoft 365 app within the fingertips of employees with Viva Connections** – use a common set of back-end APIs to provide enterprise level functionalities to a host of UIs - Teams, Outlook, Office.com, Viva and ACEs built with SPFx components. The example scenario – An office desk booking app. Security and API hosting from Azure, data in SharePoint lists. Reports in Power BI, Booking cards in Teams and Viva Connections Dashboard. Notifications in Outlook. Thorough code walkthrough.
