### Demos

* **Extend Microsoft Teams apps to Office and Outlook Mobile** – start with an overview of the Office mobile app, current beta program and release roadmap. Then configure your developer tenant so you can build a custom app and have it surface in an Android Office app. Tips on configuring dev and debug environment. Scaffold a project, use Android Studio, run virtual version of Android phone, see simple app on mobile and how to provide feedback.
* **General Availability of Power Pages - Getting started** – extending the reach of the Power Platform outside the organization via a data connected website that is publicly accessible, either anonymous or authenticated. Step through a host of features in the reimagined Design Studio (Pages, Styling, Data and Setup workspaces) delivering a WYSIWYG experience for makers. IT Pros will appreciate the go live checklist and pro developers the ability to edit/customize in Microsoft Visual Studio.
* **Using your SPFx solutions also in Microsoft Teams, Outlook and in the Microsoft 365 app** – in other words, now you can host Teams personal apps (developed with SPFx v1.16) in Outlook and in Microsoft 365 app (previously known as office.com). The same code in SharePoint, Teams, Viva, Viva Connections, Outlook and Microsoft 365 app. You will need to create a custom manifest.json file shown in demo. In the next SPFx v1.16 beta release, the typings are changing to teams-js-v2.
