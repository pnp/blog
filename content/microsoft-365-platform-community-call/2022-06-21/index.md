* **Get started with UI Library for Azure Communication Services** – with actual UX controls not just APIs, developers and UI designers can use to easily create a UI that integrates ACS capabilities. Learn about ACS capabilities including Teams/Microsoft 365 interoperability, product availability, UI Library Design Kit, and the low/no code sample app builder. UI Library Design Kit has pre-built open-source production ready composites, components and UX guidance enabling you to build modern communications user experiences.
