### Demos

* **Using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for common operations** – quick tour of PowerShell Gallery (powershellgallery.com) – install modules, see how authentication works (both in Delegated and App-only permissions scenarios for any CRUD operation), find permissions (discover cmdlets based on (Graph REST) URLs and identify permissions required for apps based on cmdlets used), differentiate between beta and v1 endpoints, obtain Auth sign-in information and run reports using Out-GridView that dumps results into a CSV file.
* **Get started with UI Library for Azure Communication Services** – with actual UX controls not just APIs, developers and UI designers can use to easily create a UI that integrates ACS capabilities. Learn about ACS capabilities including Teams/Microsoft 365 interoperability, product availability, UI Library Design Kit, and the low/no code sample app builder. UI Library Design Kit has pre-built open-source production ready composites, components and UX guidance enabling you to build modern communications user experiences.
