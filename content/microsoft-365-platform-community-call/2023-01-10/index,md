### Demos

* **Introduction Microsoft Graph PowerShell v2 preview release** – review features/improvements from v1 to v2 modules. Understand scripting for and how endpoints are targeted by modules, improvements to and support for more auth scenarios (managed identity support), and other improvements. In Azure Cloud Shell, appreciate the ease of installing a module, authentication, getting users, grouping users and deleting users/groups. Uses new managed identity to make calls without certificates and secrets. Feedback welcome.
* **Test how your SPFx solutions respond to throttling with Graph Developer Proxy** – in SharePoint Workbench, in your tenant of 1, keeping you’re app code as is, simulate your app’s resilience under heavy load. Example: Test specifically for 429 errors. See configuring Proxy for scenario and then see how Proxy simulates/identifies 429s on a Microsoft Graph API. Once issue identified, remediate - add a sleep function, use PnPjs that handles 429s for you, etc.
* **Introduction to Microsoft Viva ACE development learn module - Getting started** – learn about the new module in general and do 1st Exercise - Create a SPFx Basic Card ACE showing SharePoint list data. This ACE reads and writes to a SharePoint List. In hands-on lab, open your Workbench and site and add ACE to page. Look at operation of Card View, Quick View and at the target SharePoint list. Step through the AdaptiveCardExtension.ts, CardView.ts and QuickView.ts files.
