### Demos

* **Latest on deprecating basic auth for Exchange** - an impactful change to be aware. Beginning October 1, 2022, Microsoft will *start* to turn off Basic Auth for a number of mail protocols. Microsoft is not turning off the protocols. And fortunately, the protocols all support modern OAuth today. Understand where to look for usage data, tips for interpreting the data (based on protocol), next steps check list, and Useful Links.
* **Introduction to Microsoft Graph .Net SDK v5** - generated by the new code generator called Kiota – v5 enhancements covered in this session that enrich the developer’s experiences across Microsoft Graph include Backing store (object tracking), support \$count endpoints, support for OData Cast endpoints and Parameter objects. Appreciate differences between v4 and v5 calls, improvements in Intellisense, increased performance due to smaller payloads, newly supported endpoints, fewer lines of code for greater capability, etc.
* **Introduction to Microsoft Graph Postman collection** - starts with Postman fundamentals then how Postman – the tool, is used with Microsoft Graph - the APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so that you can create better APIs faster. Use the 8 step Microsoft Graph Postman collection to get started with Microsoft Graph APIs in minutes and get simplified authentication, pre-defined endpoints, and environment variables.
