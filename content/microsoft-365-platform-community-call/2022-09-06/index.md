### Demos

* **Latest on eDiscovery Premium APIs on Microsoft Graph** – since July announcement, there are new Microsoft Graph “eDiscovery” APIs supporting automating common Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management (SCIM) workflows under the Microsoft Purview brand. Focusing on eDiscovery Premium (eDP) APIs targeted for v1 release, we look at use cases, and specifically at a demo of case creation in Postman. A review of licensing/monetization, demo environments, trials and supporting resources.
* **New features in SharePoint Framework 1.16 preview** – include Top Actions support for web parts (demoed today), Teams JavaScript SDK v2 native support in SPFx solutions, and Asynchronous support for Viva Connections ACEs rendering. Top Actions support allows developers to add custom buttons or custom dropdowns to the web part's command bar. Like property pane controls but based on cleaner UI approach. Also review features in development and tentative release dates.
* **Introduction to Microsoft Graph X-Ray project** – use this Chrome, Edge and Windows Browser extension to go from Microsoft Azure Active Directory Portal actions to Microsoft Graph PowerShell in seconds. Step through use case - how get a list of all dynamic groups inside my tenant? What APIs are called? See it done the old way and see it done using Microsoft Graph X-Ray. View PowerShell, JS, Java, C#, Objective-C, and Go commands.
