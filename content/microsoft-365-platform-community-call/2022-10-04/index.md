### Demos

* **Introduction to Privacy APIs on Microsoft Graph** – automating Security, Compliance, Identity and Management (SCIM) with new Microsoft Graph APIs for Records Management, eDiscovery Premium and Privacy. Today’s demo focuses on Privacy or Subject Rights Requests (SRR) – creation and status. See SRR queries in Postman and results in Rights Requests portal. Details about licensing/monetization, demo environments/trials and available resources. The APIs will be soon available GA on the v1 endpoint.
* **Build your first Notification bot for Microsoft Teams with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** – Notification bots are great for sending pro-active messages into Microsoft Teams. Let’s create this bot now! Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code and scaffold a project to create a Notification bot with HTTP and Timer Trigger (Azure Functions) and use TypeScript. Inspect what the toolkit has provisioned, trigger the bot for the first time and wrap up with summary and resources.
* **Account Linking for Teams apps** – learn how to migrate a non-Azure AD Web App to Microsoft Teams and deliver a Single Sign On (SSO) experience. This sample shows the linking of a user's AAD id with their GitHub or SaaS app identity in an IdentityMap stored in a database. At login, the Authorization is based on associated (linked) identities found in Map. Also see how associations are added to map.
