### Demos

* **Extend your Teams Search Based Message Extension to Outlook** – search messaging extensions are Adaptive Cards (rendered in Teams and now in Outlook) and contain links to external content. See three steps for updating an existing messaging extension – update app manifest (manually or with Teams toolkit), add Outlook channel for bot (in Azure Portal or Bot Framework Portal), and sideload updated app in Teams. Capability in public developer preview. Covered Roadmap, more announcements at Microsoft Build.
* **Getting started on using Azure Communication Services in your web site** – glimpse the future in this demo showing some of the present capabilities of ACS – the same platform leveraged by Microsoft Teams, can be leveraged by you. Add voice and video calling capabilities to your web apps. Demo shows securely connecting 2 users through the ACS infrastructure and the few lines of code enabling this. ACS is fully managed by Microsoft. Use cases reviewed, sample provided.
