### Demos

* **SPFx v1.17 release - what's new and what's there** – a direction update on SPFx and extensibility platform for Microsoft 365. SPFx v1.17 capabilities reviewed include: Use TeamsJS SDK v2.9.1, OS variable now in serve.json configuration, web part TopActions, Sync to Teams, Action handler for ACE, focus parameters in ACE quick view, and Adaptive Cards v1.5 schema support. Beyond v1.17 capabilities also described.
* **Kiota SDK generator is now available - What you need to know!** – Kiota is GA. It is presently being rolled into Graph Explorer and into a VS Code Extension. Kiota enables you to create and add a powerful, super specific API client to work inside your application. See how a package is created and added to your solution by stepping through a scenario to sync PRs from GitHub (a single endpoint) right into your Microsoft ToDo app.
* **Deploy a Microsoft Teams app to Azure using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** – you’ve built an awesome app on your local machine, now it’s time to move it to a remote environment to validate and share with others. The move is streamlined with 3 Toolkit features - provision to cloud, deploy to cloud, and publishing to your organization. In this example a simple tab app makes its way to the Teams admin portal and can be added to Teams.
