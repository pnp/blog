* Conversations
    * Microsoft 365 PnP Weekly – Episode 187 (November 14th) with Velencia, Spain based SharePoint and Cloud Solution Architect and Microsoft MVP [Luis Máñez](https://twitter.com/luismanez) (ClearPeople) \| @luismanez \| [video](https://pnp.github.io/blog/microsoft-365-pnp-weekly/episode-187/) \| [podcast](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-zufjw-1314b06)

### Demos

* **Calling Microsoft Graph from Polyglot Notebooks (.Net Interactive)** – a recent Hackathon innovation – Interactive documentation and samples executed within a browser. Multiple (code) languages on same page. Microsoft Graph magic command / extension for [.Net Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive). .NET Interactive takes the power of .NET and embeds it into various interactive experiences - run graph SDK code against multiple SDKs, multiple national clouds, multiple versions. What do you think? Please provide feedback.
* **Add Azure AD single sign-on to your Microsoft Teams bots using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** – Teams Toolkit makes it easy to add SSO assets to your bot projects. You have a bot, now add single sign-on (SSO) to call APIs like Microsoft Graph. Setup auth flow, implement command, update configuration, and then see how a user is authenticated by the bot calling the Microsoft Graph API. TeamsFX simplifies working with authentication, and with SSO enabled commands.
