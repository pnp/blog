## Demos

Demos delivered in this session

-   **Microsoft 365 Application Certification --** Microsoft 365 App
    compliance program overview, publisher verification -- how to add a
    verified publisher to your app, and Microsoft 365 app certification
    experiences within Azure AD.    *Unfortunately, due to a technical
    hiccup, we did not capture Arpitha's entire demo in the session
    recording. We will work with Arpitha to re-record her demo and
    communicate its availability through social channels.   * 

-   **Consume a multi-tenant API within Viva Connections Adaptive Card
    Extensions (ACEs) --** this reference (Order management) solution
    shows surfacing relevant partner hosted business data from a secured
    API hosted through Azure AD and how to consume a multi-tenant API
    within a set of Microsoft Viva Connections Adaptive Card Extensions
    (ACEs) developed with SharePoint Framework (SPFx). The API needs to
    be consented and API permissions approved to be called in the
    customer's tenant.

-   **Introduction to Microsoft Graph Go SDK --** Preview SDK that
    allows Go developers to access Microsoft Graph with streamlined
    authentication and more.  Specifically -- the Microsoft Graph Go SDK
    allows you to connect and retrieve data for any of the supported
    Microsoft 365 services that are available on Microsoft Graph. Key
    benefits -- authentication (Azure Identity), Fluent Style UI, and a
    Middleware pipeline (handlers). Go code snippets are rendered in
    Graph Explorer.

Thank you for your work. Samples are often showcased in Demos.
