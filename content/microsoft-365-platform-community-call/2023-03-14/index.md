### Demos

* **Microsoft Graph Hackathon – Recap on the second week** – you have until end of day, March 15th to submit your app. This is all about using Microsoft Graph in .NET apps (web, console, desktop). Use the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK to accelerate your coding effort. You and/or your team (up to 4 persons total) are invited to participate, win prizes and a Credly badge. Hurry, happy coding and good luck!
* **Boost your conversations in Microsoft Teams with Chat GPT AI and Power Virtual Agents** – by creating responses in real time with GPT and without needing to author content in the bot. Control GPT experience by limiting the content accessed (corporate approved), by the Power Virtual Agent (PVT). Generated responses include short answer and links to supporting content. Capability included in the Public Preview delivers a new paradigm for how topics will be created and managed for conversational agents.
* **Deploying the Azure Communications Services Application to Azure** – many deployment options, in this demo we will use Azure Static Web Apps. Set up a GitHub Repo using the GitHub command line tool. Insert your ACS React app in Repo. Go to Azure Portal and create a Static Web App, point to your app in Repo. Pass in environment variables and click to deploy app and APIs. Part 6 – final in series.
