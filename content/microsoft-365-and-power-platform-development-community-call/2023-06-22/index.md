## Call summary

Welcome to the bi-weekly call focused on Microsoft 365 platform development topics. In this call, we focus on Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Graph, Power Platform, SharePoint, Microsoft Lists with topics ranging from development tools to list and column formatting, to site design and provisioning, and more.

### Demos

* **Create and Publish your first Power Virtual Agent in less than 15 mins** – start with getting PVA, create a new chatbot, step through what’s provisioned out-of-the-box. Create a topic and trigger phases, add actions, define options and conditions, name variables, test and debug bot in chat window in real-time. Add an image and text to a message. Add a flow, define inputs/outputs. Publish the PVA to selected environment - Teams for today. Share bot for internal review. Conversation at [aka.ms/June22-Demo1](https://aka.ms/June22-Demo1)
* **Trimming SharePoint file versions to reduce Storage costs** – What is SharePoint storage?, How is usage calculated?, What does it cost?, How do I minimize the SharePoint Storage consumption? Proactive - reduce number versions saved from 500 to 50 (Retention policy). Reactive - use script – to calculate potential storage reduction and the File version Trimmer. See code for calculating storage used in site collection and call to DeleteVersions function. Use the PowerShell Remove-PnPFileVersion function. Conversation at [aka.ms/June22-Demo2](https://aka.ms/June22-Demo1)
* **Using ChatGPT (or your favorite AI) to speed up PowerShell Development** – what is AI?, how can AI help me write better code?, what 2 tools are used by the speaker and for what purpose? GitHub Copilot - \$10/month. ChatGPT - Chat with it, know that it compliments GitHub Copilot - \$20 a month. Speaker prompts both assistants for information and refines results. Interesting usage research referenced. Conversation at [aka.ms/June22-Demo3](https://aka.ms/June22-Demo1)
