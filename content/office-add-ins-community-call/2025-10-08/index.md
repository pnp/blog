## Q&A (Question & Answers)

Note that there are still some questions we are tracking down answers for and we will post them here soon, or follow up on the next community call during the Q&A session.

**Is there any updated on the ability for Smart Alerts to be supported in Outlook mobile?**

It's something that's on our radar and we expect work on this to start soon. It's a large, complex piece of work on Outlook mobile, so we do not have a definitive ETA yet. But the work is in progress to enable Smart Alerts on Outlook Mobile.

**The item change event in Outlook works in classic but on OWA and new Outlook it doesn't fire consistently. For details, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/5537293/itemchanged-event-not-triggered-sometimes-on-chang?comment=answer-12261379&page=1#comment-2249453 and  https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/6101 **

We have someone looking into this and we'll share more updates on the GitHub issue once we are able to reproduce the problem.

**What is the best place to ask about updates on issues/feature requests (I have the office bug#)?**

If there is a bug with Office.js APIs or Office Add-ins, please create an issue at [https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-js](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-js).
