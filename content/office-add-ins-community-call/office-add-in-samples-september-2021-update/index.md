The Office Add-ins developer platform team has new updates to share this
month on Office Add-in samples.

## Open data from your web site in a spreadsheet in Microsoft Teams

This sample accomplishes the following tasks.

-   Creates a new Excel spreadsheet in Microsoft Teams containing data
    you define.
-   Embeds your add-in into the Excel spreadsheet.
-   Creates a message in Microsoft Teams with a link to the new
    spreadsheet.

Check out the code sample: [Open data from your web site in a
spreadsheet in Microsoft
Teams.](https://github.com/officedev/pnp-officeaddins/tree/main/Samples/excel-open-in-teams)

## Improvements to sample documentation

We created a simple list of Office Add-in samples at [Office Add-in code
samples - Office Add-ins | Microsoft
Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-in-code-samples).
This should make it easier to search for and find the samples you need.
Let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions about the samples at
<https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins>.
