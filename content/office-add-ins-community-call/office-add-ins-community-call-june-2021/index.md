## Q&A (Question & Answers)

Unfortunately, we had some issues with the chat during the call. We
apologize to folks who were not able to ask a question. If you have a
question, you can reach out to us by using our short [survey
form](https://aka.ms/officeaddinsform). We'll address any questions in
the form during the next call.
**Can you fix Teams add-ins functionality for online meetings?
Association between Outlook events and online meetings is non-existent.
The Teams SDK currently works online with single instance meetings, but
there is no way to associate custom data with event instance and event
series. For example, the SDK does not let you get meeting instance start
time.**

We can help with Office Add-ins development, but this is a good question
for Microsoft Teams. We recommend asking this question on
[office-teams-app-dev - Microsoft
Q&A.](https://learn.microsoft.com/answers/topics/office-teams-app-dev.html)
Thanks!
**Are there plans to provide access to the Outlook auto-complete list
via office-js? The list is available in the UI on mobile, OWA and
desktop clients while entering recipients. It would be useful for us to
be able to access it (or a list of commonly used email addresses for the
user) via office-js to check the entered recipients.**

There are no plans at this time, but this sounds like a great idea!
Please create a feature request for this on our ideas page at
[https://aka.ms/m365dev-suggestions](https://aka.ms/m365dev-suggestions).
Thanks!


**There are many videos and articles about Single sign-on for Office
Add-ins. The Yeoman generator uses the NPM package "msal" but there is
also an NPM package called "@azure/msal-browser" and another one
called "@azure/msal-react". Can these all be used inside an Office
Add-in? Which ones are the recommended ones to use?**


 In general you can use most web libraries with an Office Add-in. For
SSO you don't need an authentication library to get the user identity
token, since you just call
[**getAccessToken**](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/office-runtime/officeruntime.auth?view=excel-js-preview#getAccessToken_options_)().
However, you should implement a fallback sign-in dialog for scenarios
where SSO will fail. In these cases using an authentication library
makes the process easier. There is no requirement to use MSAL, but if
you do, you should use the official MSAL package for the
framework/language of choice as recommended by Microsoft Azure. For more
information see [Enable single sign-on for Office Add-ins - Office
Add-ins | Microsoft
Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/sso-in-office-add-ins)


**I am attempting to implement the shared JavaScript runtime. However, I
get an error when adding the \<Runtimes> section. The error is: The
element 'Host' in namespace
'**[**http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides**](http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides)**'
has invalid child element 'Runtimes' in namespace
'**[**http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides**](http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides)**'.
List of possible elements expected: 'AllFormFactors,
DesktopFormFactor' in namespace
'**[**http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides**](http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides)**'.**

This error can occur if the \<Runtimes> section is not in the expected
location. Be sure to put the \<Runtimes> section just below the \<Host>
tag as follows:
\<Hosts>

  \<Host xsi:type="Workbook"\>

  \<Runtimes>

    \<Runtime resid="Taskpane.Url" lifetime="long" />

  \</Runtimes>
In general if you run into a manifest error, you can compare the
manifest to one that works and look for any significant differences. For
example you could compare against this [PnP sample
manifest](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/blob/main/Samples/excel-shared-runtime-scenario/manifest.xml)
that uses a shared runtime.

You can also run [manifest
validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/troubleshoot-manifest)
which can provide more information about the error.
