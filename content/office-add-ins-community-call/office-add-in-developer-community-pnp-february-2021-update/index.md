The Office Add-ins developer platform team has new updates to share this
month on Office Add-ins Patterns and Practices. PnP is a community
effort, so if you are interested in contributing, see our [good first
issue
list](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Create custom contextual tabs on the ribbon

![create-custom-contextual-tabs-on-the-ribbon.png](images/create-custom-contextual-tabs-on-the-ribbon.png)

This sample shows how to create a custom contextual tab on the ribbon in
the Office UI. The sample creates a table, and when the user moves the
focus inside the table, the custom tab is displayed. When the user moves
outside the table, the custom tab is hidden.

-   Check out the code sample: [Create custom contextual tabs on the
    ribbon](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/tree/master/Samples/office-contextual-tabs)
-   Check out the docs: [Create custom contextual tabs in Office
    Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/design/contextual-tabs)

## About Office Add-ins Patterns & Practices (PnP)

Office Add-ins PnP is a Microsoft-led, community driven effort that
helps developers extend, build, and provision customizations on the
Office platform the right way by providing guidance and help through
official documentation and open source initiatives. The source is
maintained in GitHub where anyone can participate. You can provide
contributions to the samples, reusable components, and documentation.
Office Add-ins PnP is owned and coordinated by Office engineering teams,
but the work is done by the community for the community.

You can find code samples for Office Add-in development in the [Office
Add-ins PnP repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins). Some
samples are also documented in the [Office Add-ins
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/), such as [Open in
Excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/excel/pnp-open-in-excel).
