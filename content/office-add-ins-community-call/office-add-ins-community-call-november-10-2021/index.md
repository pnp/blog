## Q&A (Question & Answers)


### **Microsoft 365 developer program and instant sandbox**

**Is the developer subscription as persistent as a paid subscription? To
mimic a real environment I also attached my custom domain. Is that still
possible?**\
It is a durable subscription. If you're coming from Visual Studio, this
subscription will automatically update as part of the Visual Studio
subscription. Otherwise, you need to show developer activity within 90
days to be renewed. You don't control the domain name in the sandbox.
To configure the domain name, you'll need the customizable sandbox (the
previous sandbox experience).
**So now we can get two sandboxes using one dev account?**\
Yes.
**When you enroll in the Microsoft 365 developer program, can you choose
an instant or a provisioned account?**\
Yes, you choose when you sign up.
**How do we reset a sandbox?**
Today we don't have the ability to reset. However your old tenant will
expire naturally if you don't use it.
**Is Visio included in the Microsoft 365 developer program?**
Visio is not included in the Microsoft 365 developer program E5
subscription today.

### Unit testing with the Office JS Office-Addin-Mock library**

**How do we unit test or integrate Cypress into an Outlook plugin?**\
It doesn't seem likely this would work as Cypress is more focused on
end-to-end testing, while the unit testing library we provide is
designed for unit testing frameworks.
**How do we unit test if we are using Excel.run?**\
Yes, there's a sample demonstrating this:
<https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-TaskPane/tree/master/test/unit> 

### Miscellaneous

-   **With the Outlook REST API being decommissioned in November 2022 in
    favor of Graph API, what happens to on-premise Exchange REST API
    support at that time? We have add-ins that use the REST API for
    mobile. Will the REST API still be usable at that time and does the
    decommissioning just apply to Office 365?**
-   **Are there any plans to publish a migration guide or best practices
    to Microsoft Graph from the Outlook REST API, which will be
    decommissioned in November 2022?**
-   **The Outlook REST API is being decommissioned next year. Can you
    outline what exactly the impact of this will be? For example, will
    the service be turned off for Office 365 causing mobile add-ins that
    were using the add-in to stop working? Will Exchange 2016
    environments continue to work, or will an update be pushed out to
    turn off the API on those?**

Thanks for the inquiries about the Outlook REST API! We understand there
are many add-ins that rely on the Outlook REST APIs. The team is working
on guidance that we hope to provide soon. In the meantime, we still
encourage you to look into the Microsoft Graph APIs for new solutions.

\
**What is the best approach to follow to distribute an Office-Add-in in
a single tenant scenario? Since every customer has a different URL,
every manifest should be customized to communicate with the customer's
web app instance.**\
For a single tenant, the best approach is typically to have the admin
distribute your add-in by using centralized deployment. For more
information, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin
center](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins).
If you are planning to use a separate manifest for each customer, then
you will still want to use centralized deployment and provide the
correct version of the manifest to each customer. If you want to support
multiple customers with one manifest, then we recommend to [Publish your
add-in on Microsoft
AppSource](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/submit-to-appsource-via-partner-center).
**I am an Office Add-in developer, eager to work with the new PowerPoint
Shape API since the August 2021 community call. When I run the "Insert
shape, line and text box" sample code on Script Lab, unlike what
happens with all other samples there, I get an error. Could it be
because I am not in the Office Insider Program?**\
Yes, these are preview APIs right now, so most likely, you'll need to
use the insider version of Office to work with them. You can sign up for
Office Insider at <https://insider.office.com/>.
**Is there an API we can use for previewing files in Office on the
web?**\
If you intend to render something such as a thumbnail preview, then no,
we don't have any APIs around this today. However, it would be great to
learn more about your scenario. Please consider submitting a feature
request for this at <https://aka.ms/m365dev-suggestions>. If you intend
to read a file then this is possible. Please refer to the [OneDrive file
storage API overview - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft
Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/onedrive-concept-overview).

**Any news when the current PowerPoint Preview API will go live?**

We are looking to release the tags API set to general availability (GA)
by end of month. The rest of the API's will GA tentatively sometime
early next year.
