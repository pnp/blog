This sample showcases how to use event-based activation in an Outlook
add-in when the user composes an email or appointment/meeting request.
It demonstrates how to run tasks based on events that fire when certain
data changes when the user:

-   adds an attachment to an email or appointment/meeting request
-   adds recipients or distributions lists as required or optional
    attendees in a meeting request
-   changes the start or end date or time in an appointment/meeting
    request
-   adds a notification message to the item when a new email or
