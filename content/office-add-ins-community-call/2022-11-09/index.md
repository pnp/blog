## Q&A (Question & Answers)
**We'd also love an update on [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/2955) - Outlook OWA UI has been updated for some users and there is no way for them to open add-ins in compose mode. Major issue.**

We've assigned the issue to the Outlook team for further investigation.

**Hi, anyone working on Outlook add-in - SSO with .Net Core - adding Authentication in Middleware. and adding redirect URI? This works in Outlook on Windows but fails in Outlook on the web.**

We usually debug SSO issues with the browser dev tools. If you haven't already, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues), so that we can assist you further.

**Any one working on Excel add-in pivot table function and connect with external data source mainly cube in pivot table inside add-in?**

If you're experiencing issues with developing an Excel add-in, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues), so that we can assist you further.

**For PowerPoint, it would be interesting if the app asked the user if they wanted to compress the embedded video. I have done this on my decks, but it is kind of buried for the average user.**

We will pass on this feedback to the team.

**Why rich text for Word Online content controls? Plain text is so much more useful for integration because there's no formatting jargon**

We are planning to roll out support for Plain Text content controls editing soon.

**To be clear, we are still not able to create the Content Controls in Word Online?**

That's correct. Creating content controls in Word on the web still isn't possible. They need to be created with via the Word desktop client or the JS API.

**Has anyone had challenges with Outlook Add-ins when using the "Microsoft 365 Features - Shared calendar improvements" setting in Outlook Windows Desktop? Our Outlook add-in sets extended properties with Graph (public and private) for meetings on shared/delegate calendars.When the setting is on, the meeting won't send. When we turn it off, everything works as expected.**

We're sorry to hear you're experiencing challenges with developing your Outlook add-in. If you haven't already, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues), so that we can assist you.

**Would the search work only by the add-in name, or use some additional descriptions? In other words, how do you match the Office Add-in to the user search phrase in the new search functionality?**

We continuously improve the matching logic, but the most effective way today would be to match the add-in titles directly.


**How about data-bound content controls?**

This is one of the things we are considering. We would love to hear more of your use case via [https://aka.ms/WordAPI](https://aka.ms/WordAPI).
