## Q&A (Question & Answers)

**I had a question responded to in the June 2024 call and I was asked to clarify my scenario. Old question: Is there a way to allow two separate instances of office applications to communicate via Office.js? New question: If I have two Office.js task panes; one running in an instance of Word and another running in an instance of Excel on the same machine, is there a way I can obtain a reference to the running Excel application from the Word task pane (or vice versa) to emulate a temporary communication layer between the two running applications?
To clarify, this would be a cross-application scenario. It is not necessary (but ideal) for the two task panes to communicate, but the ability to, for example, get the selected data in Excel from a user's actions in the Word task pane would be invaluable.**

To learn how to use Graph API to get access to Excel application data in your Word add-in, see [Excel workbooks and charts API overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/excel-concept-overview). However, this doesn’t work if you want to get access to Word data from Excel, so you may consider using a server to communicate between. 

**Is there a way to use Microsoft Playwright (https://playwright.dev/) to test desktop add-ins?**

For Office add-in testing, we recommend you use the [Office-Addin-Mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-addin-mock) library with JavaScript unit testing framework. For more examples, see [Unit testing in Office Add-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/unit-testing).

**Not related to compliance or certification but my question relates to Copilot for M365 and the new add-in platform: Will the new add-in platform allow customizations to Copilot or are the two completely different things. If so, how can we work with Copilot in our add-ins?**

We are investigating scenarios for how Copilot and Office Add-ins could work together but have no public plans to share at this time.  If there are scenarios or functionality you'd like to suggest, please let us know through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Platform Ideas forum](https://aka.ms/m365dev-suggestions).
