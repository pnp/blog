## Q&A (Question & Answers)

**A few months ago, Smart Alerts for Outlook were introduced. At the time, one of the slides said that Smart Alerts run in "js-engine" for Win32 and WebView for OWA. We are finding that there are limitations when using the "js-engine" runtime; the same code works when using WebView for OWA. Where can we find documentation on the "js-engine" features and limitations?**

Still investigating this question.


**Will the delay be removed for the centralized deployment as well? Admin deployed addins from the store?**

I don't have the answers to this but I hear the need for quick deployment across multiple surfaces.

**Does the pin feature still apply only for Outlook? Or also for other products?**

Right now we are doing pinning per client - so it would apply to Outlook only M365 Admin will be auto pinned. We aspire to have them have pin/unpin level of control but no timeline on that.

**"Customer is able to pin or un-pin" Does "customer" here refer to end user or M365 Admin?**

Customer refers to the end user.

**Will sideloading work the same way in Word and Excel as well?**

 The new Store provides a new view of AppSource to help you search and install add-ins for Outlook.

**Where would you go to rate or recommend an addin in this new experience?So the in app experience to rate an add-in is gone?Really? When I go to my add-ins in PowerPoint I can't see that option anymore. Am I missing something?**

You can rate the add-ins on the App Source website: [Business Apps – Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps?page=1&product=excel%3Bpowerpoint%3Bword) You can still find the rating entry point from the in app store (My add-ins)
