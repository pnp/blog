Want to understand what types of apps you can build on Microsoft 365?
Want to get inspired by the scenarios you could implement? Curious about
the different extensibility points available for developers?
 
Check out the new **Microsoft 365 Extensibility look book**: an
interactive gallery that helps you understand how you can extend
Microsoft 365 with custom apps. The look book has been announced at
Ignite '21 and is publicly available at
<https://aka.ms/m365/extensibility>.
 

Microsoft 365 Extensibility look book explains the Microsoft 365
extensibility opportunity using three pivots: **products**, **type of
apps** and **scenarios**. Using these pivots, you can learn what's
possible in a way that's intuitive for your role.
 

Microsoft 365 developers, familiar with Microsoft's technology, can
jump to the specific Microsoft product and learn how to extend it. New
developers can explore the opportunities by looking at the different
types of apps. Business decision makers can look at the scenarios to
start conversations in their organization and drive demand for building
custom apps on Microsoft 365.
 

Each page in the look book contains links to existing resources on
Microsoft Docs, Learn, YouTube and GitHub to help you learn how to get
started building these apps.
 

We're excited to share the Microsoft 365 Extensibility look book with
you and hope you'll find it helpful in your conversations with your
colleagues and customers. And please, don't hesitate to let us know if
you have suggestions how we could improve it.
