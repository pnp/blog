This is already the third part of my little series on what it takes to
do the[Â Microsoft Graph Fundamentals Learning
Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-msgraph-fundamentals/)Â on
Microsoft Learn. If you missed [part
1Â ](https://m365princess.com/microsoft-graph-fundamentals-learning-path-module-1/)or
[part
2](https://m365princess.com/microsoft-graph-fundamentals-learning-path-module-2/),
it would be a good idea to catch up first, as the parts build upon each
other.

Â 

After we already saw how easily we could configure a JavaScript
application to retrieve Microsoft 365 data using Microsoft Graph in the
last module, we will focus this time on how to access user photo
information by using Microsoft Graph.

This module is supposed only to take 17 minutes to complete - timer set
:smiling_face_with_halo:.

Â 

## Â intro

Our goal is to insert a user profile in our app that we already used in
the last module. We will need to authenticate our user using Microsoft
identity and receive an access token and call Microsoft Graph API with
this token. - If you now wonder, 'wait, but why?' it's a good idea to
reread part 2 of my summary or do the last module.

Â 

After making us aware of WHY we should display a user picture, we learn
that there are several ways to get profile picture information with
Microsoft Graph, for example\
\`GET <https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/photo/$value>\` gets us the
image of the signed-in user itself. I used the Graph Explorer to check
that:

Let's do an exercise:

## Exercise - Use Microsoft Graph in your web application to retrieve a user's profile photo

### build upon module 2

As we are building upon the last module, we will not need to clone the
repository again. The unit quickly walks us through the four primary
files for our app \`index.html\`, \`auth.js\`, \`graph.js\` and
\`ui.js\` to make us aware of what they will do and repeats the steps we
did in module 2 to insert tenant ID and application ID.

### Â Now the new part

1.  copy - paste two code snippets into the \`index.html\` file to
create and style a button with an image element\
2. add a function to the \`graph.js\` file to call Microsoft Graph API
and retrieve the photo of the signed-in user\
3. add a function to the \`ui.js\` file that displays the image that we
got from Graph into the image element that we created and styled in step
1\
4. copy-paste a snippet to show a button that a signed-in user can click
on to view their profile picture.

### time to run our app

Like in Module 2, open your terminal (I use the built-in PowerShell in
Visual Studio Code) and type in \`npm start\`, which will open your
browser with \`localhost:8080\`.

\* Select  \*\*Sign in with Microsoft\*\*\
\* Select the \`show profile picture\` button\
\* see that profile pic? YAY - time for a happy dance- You made it!

## conclusion

As I did module 2 just a couple of days before, I did not need to
reinvent the wheel, and it took me way less than 17 minutes to complete
this module 3 - but I realized that I could reuse this app over and over
again to whenever I need to sign-in a user or want to display
information that I can get from Microsoft Graph API.

Â 

I wrote this summary of the whole learning path because I worked with
Microsoft Graph before, and although I don't write (a lot) of code
daily, these modules felt doable - even if you are not a super
experienced developer. I hope there will be even more cool content!

If you now read this and wonder if you could build applications with
Microsoft Graph as well: Yes, you can! To learn more - from developers,
please join Microsoft's Learn Together event:Â [Building apps with
Microsoft GraphÂ ](https://learntogether-graph.splashthat.com/)%20)on
April 14!

Â 

I would love to hear your feedback! Did you start this learning path? Or
completed it? What were your aha moments? Where did you struggle? What
content is now needed to take you to the next level? Please comment
