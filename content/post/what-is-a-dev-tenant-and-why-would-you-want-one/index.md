By visiting [Developer Program - Microsoft
365](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program "Developer Program - Microsoft 365") and
selecting "Join Now" you'll be walked through a wizard that will help
you provision your very own Microsoft 365 tenant. You can see the
details
[in the developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program#Subscription) but
the general idea is that you'll have a tenant, where you get to be the
omnipotent global admin, with 25 E5 Microsoft 365 licenses available to
you that allow you to build out and test various scenarios within the
ecosystem.

25 E5 licenses is a lot of horsepower to begin building out scenarios
that mix the various tools of Microsoft 365 tenant (SharePoint, Teams,
OneDrive, PowerApps, PowerAutomate, etc) into solutions for your
"customers". Although I know many people who advocate and joke about
"build it in production", the reality is that doing so is invasive and
can have catastrophic consequences. As with many things you need to
weigh the pros and the cons but the ability to fully realize and test
your solutions in a "safe space" is powerful and can make you try things
you might not if you're worried about bringing down production.

Better yet, if you continue to use the tenant, every 90 days it will
auto renew so that you never have to worry about losing your work in
progress. In addition, for those that work with Microsoft 365 every day
the ability to keep up with what's going on, what's changing, and how to
best implement your ideas is priceless. You can keep up with the status
of your subscription by visiting the [Dashboard - Microsoft 365 Dev
Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/profile "Dashboard - Microsoft 365 Dev Center")
page.

## Understanding the relationship between Azure and a "Tenant"

When building in the cloud we developers no longer have the same access
to the "server" as we may be used to. The way we architect solutions for
SaaS solutions has changed significantly and many people are aware that
Azure provides various cloud-based resources to help with the automation
scenarios that were lost when we left "on-prem".

It's important to understand that each Microsoft 365 tenant has an
equivalent Azure Active Directory (AAD) associated with it, including
your brand-new shiny dev tenant. So, when you log into Azure the first
time you need to be logging in with a global administrator account for
your dev tenant. Once you are in Azure you then need to make sure you
have a Subscription set up that is associated with that Azure Active
Directory instance that is related to your dev tenant. By doing so you
are effectively simulating what most production scenarios look like.\* 

If you already have an Azure subscription you use for development
purposes, but it's not associated with your dev tenant, you can change
it. The ever-talented [Laura
Kokkarinen](https://twitter.com/LauraKokkarinen "Laura Kokkarinen Twitter") has
a wonderful blog post ([How to use the complimentary Azure credits in a
Microsoft 365 dev tenant --- step by step
(laurakokkar\...](https://laurakokkarinen.com/how-to-use-the-complimentary-azure-credits-in-a-microsoft-365-developer-tenant-step-by-step/)
that covers all the ways you might have azure credits and how to get
them associated with your dev tenant.

\*It should be said that many ISVs and other 3^rd^ party software
providers might be looking to build solutions that target multiple
tenants and thereby their Azure subscription, although tied to AAD is
not targeted for a single AAD.

## Sample Data

Another awesome feature of these developer subscriptions is the ability
to seed the tenant with sample data packs. To do this all you have to do
is go to your [Dashboard - Microsoft 365 Dev
Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/profile "Dashboard - Microsoft 365 Dev Center")
page and select  the kind of data pack you would like to add. You must
have the "Users" sample data pack first but then you can also add Mail
and Events as well as SharePoint data.

By having these data packs, it can make testing various scenarios with
your application significantly simpler as you can have up to twenty-five
accounts playing distinct roles in your scenario.

## Dev Tenant vs "[Customer Digital Transform](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/ "Customer Digital Transform Site")" Tenants

Something that may be confusing to some is the difference between the
dev tenants and "Customer Digital Transform" tenants. The latter are
Microsoft 365 tenants that you can provision if you are someone
providing sales or guidance to customers using Microsoft 365. They are
extremely useful as these tenants are fully scaled out demo environments
that can help you quickly and effectively communicate how Microsoft 365
can benefit a customer and their specific needs. These tenants however
have a limited lifespan (between 3 months and 1 year) and after that
time the tenant is decommissioned and there is no way to get them back. 
So, although once you have one of these demo tenants you can deploy and
develop inside them, as they are fully functional, just like Cinderella
when times up, time is up! As we said earlier, if you're actively using
dev tenants, they will auto renew every 90 days.

So, now that you're all up to speed, what are you waiting for?! Get
