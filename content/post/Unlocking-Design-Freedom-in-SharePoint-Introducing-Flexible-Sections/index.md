## Introduction

In early 2025, Microsoft introduced one of the most impactful enhancements to SharePoint page design in recent years — **Flexible Sections**. This new feature redefines how content creators build and structure SharePoint pages, offering a level of design freedom that was previously only possible through custom development.

In this blog, we’ll explore what Flexible Sections are, how they differ from traditional layouts, and how you can use them to create modern, responsive, and engaging SharePoint experiences.

## The Evolution of SharePoint Page Design

Before diving into Flexible Sections, it’s important to understand how SharePoint page design has evolved:

###  Classic Pages
Classic SharePoint pages were functional but rigid. They relied on fixed templates and master pages, offering limited customization and a less intuitive editing experience.

###  Modern Pages
Modern pages brought a much-needed refresh. With responsive design, modern web parts, and a better editing interface, they significantly improved usability. However, layout flexibility remained somewhat constrained due to the 1–3 column structure.

## What Are Flexible Sections?

**Flexible Sections** introduce a **freeform two-dimensional grid** layout, allowing content authors to place and arrange web parts with far greater precision and creativity. This removes the limitations of fixed columns and opens the door to visually rich, dynamic, and responsive designs.

Whether you're building a sleek landing page, a news post, or a dashboard, Flexible Sections empower you to craft experiences that are both functional and visually engaging — without compromising usability or structure.

## Key Features of Flexible Sections

Here’s what makes Flexible Sections a powerful addition to your SharePoint toolkit:

### Freeform Grid Placement

- Visual cues like drop hints and alignment guides assist with precise placement.

### Grouping Web Parts
- Group multiple web parts into a single unit for easier movement and resizing.
- Grouping persists across sessions and adapts well to mobile views.
