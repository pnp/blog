[Original Post](https://unsuckm365.com/2024/05/02/my-microsoft-365-conference-recap-may-2024-edition)

Back in 2022 I attended the [Microsoft 365 Conference](https://m365conf.com/) (the first after the pandemic hit us) and wrote my [first blog post](https://unsuckm365.com/2022/04/16/the-microsoft-365-conference-and-how-you-owe-it-to-yourself-going-to-the-next-one/) about it. My manager at the time told me I needed to improve my branding and coming back from it, I felt on fire. After many years of taking training and neglecting in-person events, I knew I had finally met my people and I decided to dig into this community that embraced me so quickly from day one. And I kept coming to every single one of them, and eventually I even started presenting at [M365 Community Days](https://www.communitydays.org/) myself, though nothing of this size. Nonetheless, things felt new and exciting for a while but then... they sort of weren't. Until this week.

## Holy Conference!

OK, so the M365 Conference is now relevant again! Seriously, from the minute I walked in, there was something different in the air this time. The past two M365 Conferences felt a little stagnant, and then Power Platform and both of its conferences pretty much took over as the new shiny thing. Now the pandemic is behind us, people are once again seeming energized and this is greatly because of the new kid on the block: Microsoft Copilot.

## Holy Copilot!

Hide your kids, hide your wife... or actually don't. Copilot is here to stay and there is just no way to hide from it or ignore it. After years of talking about SharePoint Governance, content cleanup, and letting go of digital clutter, everyone has now realized the importance of being organized and having your enterprise documents ready for Copilot. But SharePoint is just a fraction of it. Copilot is now a reality throughout the entire Microsoft 365 suite. It helps you code better, create PowerFX formulas right from the Power Apps toolbar, it even works in Whiteboard!

## Holy Loop!

Remember [Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop)? That little guy slowly crept up on us and just like Copilot is present in pretty much every single Microsoft 365 collaboration tool. Loop components can be added to your emails, Teams chats, and even OneNote notebooks. What still keeps me up at night though is how to govern all these knowledge nuggets, and to ensure business critical information does not get super fragmented and end up being lost. I did not see much of that explained in the sessions I attended so that is a subject I need to research more and would love to hear from others on what their experiences have been.

## Holy Viva Amplify!

One of the things I was excited the most to get a more in depth look here was [Viva Amplify](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/amplify), and well that just left me wishing for a bit more. The ability of managing communication campaigns using multiple channels (SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and soon Viva Engage) is great. What is not so great is that every new campaign will generate yet a new SharePoint site, thus adding another bit of complication to the life of admins and anyone working in Governance. I also think it's silly that licenses are required for all in the tenant, not just folks using the product. Sure you can send out emails and Teams messages to unlicensed users but the ability of getting data on whether they reacted to the post or not, will not be captured in the reports.

Also, I know I am wishing too much here but the ability of publicizing these campaigns via SMS would be an amazing thing to offer to front line workers, but I know this would be too complicated to add to this first iteration. As of now, Viva Amplify feels like a Minimum Viable Product kind of solution but the potential is there so hopefully things will get much better in the near future.

## Holy Speakers!

The variety of the speakers was excellent and I also liked the many lightning talks they had this year which added even more variety to the number of sessions and topics available.

Now I know time and space is limited, and this is still a Microsoft Conference after all, but we need more community speakers. I love hearing the non-biased opinion of people like me who have their hands deep in the products and hear real world examples without the feeling I am listening to a big marketing pitch. The solution hope? More people need to submit their sessions whenever the call for speakers is out and do not be afraid of rejection because most of them will get rejected. And if you do get rejected, don't pass up on the chance to attend! Show up and give your support. Look for ways you would do it differently than the presenters and how you would add your spin on things so you can improve your submissions next time. Believe it or not your reality is not unique and there are a ton of people that can relate to you. You just gotta perfect your skills and keep pushing!

Also remember [Community Days](https://www.communitydays.org/) is alive and well and there are a ton of smaller and regional events that you could get started at. Hey, thats how i did it and have learned so much over the past two plus years!

## Holy Diversity, Equity and Inclusion!

First, let me state what should be obvious: these events are and will always be a safe space! Everyone is incredibly open and accepting but work is still needed. For me, even getting a pass for a DEI luncheon was a bit complicated. Participants were informed to get their wristbands at the M365 Community Lounge, but then I got rejected multiple times and heard the spots left were reserved for executives. That sure did not stop me. I knew I belonged in the conversation and eventually I got in and I got to be the room and ultimately it's all that matters.

Being a gay man in tech is not the easiest. Being an immigrant in the US can add its complications sometimes too but I don't often see folks I can fully relate to. The conversations are great but I wish they were well more... diverse. Now, the panel of Microsoft speakers was excellent but I wish I had seen other members of the community talking about their struggles because not every employer out there is as great as Microsoft. Not every state or country is open and I want to see those peers of mine have a say in a future panel because I believe they all matter - because WE ALL MATTER!

## Holy Community!

So to finish off, let me also mention the community calls - because where else are you able to attend a live recording of [Mondays at Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/events/mondaysatmicrosoft-episode247187586030902906880) or any of the many [M365 community calls](https://pnp.github.io/#events) that happen every week? I was [right there in the room](https://twitter.com/UnsuckM365/status/1786035896346619938) and being able to say hello to the hosts is also a great way to show how important the information they provide you every week is!

Not everyone who says "this is the best community in tech" or that uses #CommunityRocks in their posts/tweets actually means it but that does not take away the fact that this is indeed the most amazing community tech! I came home with a full heart and a big smile in my face because this community is now my family!

After becoming more engaged in the M365 Community, my idols became my mentors. My mentors are also my friends. Getting to interact with so many amazing people that inspire me so much day after day is priceless. Coming to conferences have allowed me to have a seat at the table and discuss new challenges before I even face them. It has made me a better professional and the relationships I have developed are now part of my daily life. It truly feels like a family reunion and one I am so proud to be a part of.

Whether you are a seasoned pro or new in the tech field, there is not a better time to participate. This community is alive and well and I can't wait for the upcoming events. Big or small, this is what I live for, so I know I will be coming back and hopefully I get to see you next time too!

Did you attend the conference as well? If you did, and your experience was entirely different than mine (it likely was) please leave your thoughts in the comments section below.
