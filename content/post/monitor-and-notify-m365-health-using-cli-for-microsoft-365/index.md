Are you an IT Pro who wants to have a solution that checks the status of
your Microsoft 365 Tenant.

How about if you get notified when something goes wrong with your tenant
and you get that information before your users complain. Awesome, right?
**Fair** Warning : This blog post is a lengthy one since it talks about
how I created the solution. If you are only interested in script sample,
head directly to the [Complete Script Section](#powershell-scripts)

## Solution

In this blog, I am showing a way where you can schedule a script that
will check the status of your tenant. If something is not right with the
tenant, it will save the information to a SharePoint List and will
notify the user. I am also giving a bonus solution where I have created
a simple Power Automate which will identify the changes and will
complete some of the processes which are designed for notification.

[CLI for Microsoft
365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) provides some powerful and
lightweight commands via which you can get the health status of your
Office 365 Tenant. With the combination of multiple commands, you can
create a full-fledged and powerful solution through which you can get
updates, notified if some of the services are not working as expected.

In this blog, I am using Windows for showing the use case. You as a user
are not restricted to use PowerShell since [CLI for Microsoft 365 is a
cross-platform
CLI](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/about/why-cli/) and is
independent of the OS platform which you use.

## Implementation

### Authentication and Login

The biggest advantage CLI for Microsoft 365 has is its ability
to [Persist Connection
Information](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/concepts/persisting-connection/).

After logging in to Microsoft 365, the CLI for Microsoft 365 will
persist the information about the connection until you explicitly log
out from Microsoft 365. Once you have authenticated to the tenant, your
scripts will be executed without the need for authentication every time.
Since the solution is not a confidential or had complex business
process, it is safe to go ahead with this approach. CLI for Microsoft
365 also provides [logging in using a
certificate](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/connecting-microsoft-365#log-in-using-a-certificate) if
you prefer that approach.


### Get status of Tenant

The first step for the script is to get the current status using [tenant service announcement health list](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/tenant/serviceannouncement/serviceannouncement-health-list/) command.
In our case, we just want to get the services which are not normal.
Here, we use the tenant status list command and would pass [JMESPath
Query](https://jmespath.org/) since CLI for Microsoft 365 supports that.
This query is supported in cross-platform as well. We will retrieve all
the services which are not running normally and hence we would the
JMESPath query would be something
like `?Status != 'ServiceOperational'`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}.

Based on that, our command may look something like below

``` highlight
m365 tenant status list --query "value[?Status != 'ServiceOperational']"  --output json
```

>  **Another biggest advantage of CLI for Microsoft 365 is that all the
>  command provides an option for you to [return the values in a JSON
>  string](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/cli-output-mode/#json-output-mode).
>  With JSON, it is super powerful and flexible and you can easily
>  manipulate the data in your scripts.**



### Pushing to SharePoint list when Services are not normal

#### SharePoint List

Here we are using a SharePoint List in one of the SharePoint sites. The
advantage of that is, you can have the information kept and you can tag
it to a Power Automate if you want to build some logics (I have created
a Power Automate
solution so
that can you can have a look into that and design your requirements
accordingly). In my case, SharePoint List look something like below

![ArjunMenon_0-1637745741073.jpeg](images/ArjunMenon_0-1637745741073.jpeg)

#### Adding to SharePoint List if a Service is not Normal

We will be using [spo listitem
add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/listitem/listitem-add/) which
will add the item to SharePoint List. Since we are already authenticated
to your tenant, all we need to do is to use the command directly. Before
we do that, we will just check the current SharePoint list whether the
outage is already added. We plan to have the script running in a fixed
interval, say every **15 minutes** or **30 minutes**. In that case,
there is a chance that the outage is still there and we do not need the
entry to be duplicated. So we would get the items from the current
SharePoint List using the command [spo listitem
get](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/listitem/listitem-get/) and
will check whether the current outage is already there in the List.

-   If it is there,
    -   Then we will not do anything.
-   If the entry is not there,
    -   we will use the command `spo listitem add`{.language-plaintext
        .highlighter-rouge} and add the status information to SharePoint
        List

The complete command may look something like below,

``` highlight
$workLoads = m365 tenant status list --query "value[?Status != 'ServiceOperational']"  --output json  | ConvertFrom-Json
$currentOutageServices = (m365 spo listitem list --webUrl $webURL --title $listName --fields "Title, Workload, Id"  --output json).Replace("ID", "_ID") | ConvertFrom-Json

#Adding items if any of the workload is not available
$workLoads | ?{$_.Workload -notin $currentOutageServices.Workload} | %{ $addedWorkLoad = m365 spo listitem add --webUrl $webURL --listTitle $listName --contentType Item --Title $_.WorkloadDisplayName --Workload $_.Workload --FirstIdentifiedDate (Get-Date -Date $_.StatusTime -Format "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm") --WorkflowJSONData (Out-String -InputObject $_ -Width 100) }
```

You can see that, we are even pushing the JSON Data of the complete
status information so that you as an IT Pro will have detailed logs
without going to the Admin Center. Once you have the data pushed, your
status information for a particular outage may look something like
below.

### Send email to any users using CLI for Microsoft 365

#### Send email when the service is NOT Operational

CLI for Microsoft 365 gives us the power of sending an email using the
command [outlook
sendmail](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/outlook/mail/mail-send/).
With this command, it uses the logged in user's outlook to send an
email.

*Super Tip : You can also use a
flag `saveToSentItems`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} using
which you can disable to have the email saved in your sent folder.
Awesome, isn't it?*

Command may look something like below,

``` highlight
#Send notification using CLI Commands
m365 outlook mail send --to "recipient@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com" --subject "Outage Reported in $($workload.WorkloadDisplayName)" --bodyContents "Any outage has been reported for the Service : $($workload.WorkloadDisplayName) <a href='https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/M365CLI/Lists/O365%20Health%20Status'>Access the Health Status List</a>" --bodyContentType HTML
```

#### Send email when the service is back to Operational

Getting notification when the service is back to normal is equally
important compared to the notification when a Service is not
Operational.
This would enable you as an IT Pro to notify the concerned team and your
organization on that.

In the above steps, we had saved the data to a SharePoint
list when
service are not operational. When our script checks the status and
identifies that the service which was there in SharePoint List is no
more there in the non-operational list of Tenant Workloads, we can
assume that the tenant Service was **NOT Operational** is back
to **Operational**

Code which handles that is given below,

``` highlight
Foreach ($currentOutageService in $currentOutageServices){
    if($currentOutageService.Workload -notin $workLoads.Workload){
        $RemovedRecord = m365 spo listitem remove --webUrl $webURL --listTitle $listName --id  $currentOutageService.Id

        #Send notification using CLI Commands
        m365 outlook mail send --to "arjun@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com" --subject "Outage RESOLVED for $($currentOutageService.WorkloadDisplayName)" --bodyContents "Outage which was reported for the Service : $($workload.WorkloadDisplayName) is RESOLVED." --bodyContentType HTML
    }
}
```

What we do in the above code is,

-   If the item in SharePoint list is not there in list of Service which
    is NOT Operational
-   Remove the Item from the SharePoint list using the
    command [`spo listitem remove`{.language-plaintext
    .highlighter-rouge}](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/listitem/listitem-remove/)
    -   IF you want you can also copy item to another list for any
        historical purpose if needed
-   Send email to recipients informing that the Service is back to
    Normal

## Bonus Solution - Configure Power Automate for doing any Business Process

As we may know [Power
Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/) provides rich features
which we can leverage if you want to do any action based on the
available triggers. Say e.g., when your SharePoint service is not
Operational, need to initiate a Service Request in your Help Desk
support system automatically, we can always define the logic in Power
Automate and once an outage is identified, Power Automate will initiate
a Service Request in your help-desk system along with notifying
concerned team. In our case, we are using SharePoint list item Creation
/ Modification as the trigger for initiating Process. Since we are
adding list item using CLI for Microsoft 365, we can easily take that as
the triggering point

In my case, what I have done is that,

1.  Create 1 Flow which will get triggered when an item is created and
    another flow which will get triggered if an item is modified

2.  If the `Still in Outage`{.language-plaintext
    .highlighter-rouge} flag in SharePoint
    List is **YES** (Creation
    Triggered Flow)
    1.  Send notification via email informing about Outage
    2.  Send a Push Notification to the configured user

3.  If the `Still in Outage`{.language-plaintext
    .highlighter-rouge} flag in [SharePoint
    List is **No** (Modified
    Trigger Flow)
    1.  Send notification via email about Service becoming Operational

As I said, mine is a super simple implementation just to demonstrate the
Power of Power Automate which goes hand in hand with scripting tools. If
you have some business logic which needs to be in place with this, it
always gives you the flexibility for the same. Just giving a glimpse of
my simple Power Automate screen below,

### Power Automate - Creation Trigger

Below Power Automate will do the process when a new outage is reported
by the script 

![ArjunMenon_2-1637745741136.jpeg](images/ArjunMenon_2-1637745741136.jpeg)

### Power Automate - On Modified

Below is the Power Automate which is created when existing outage is
modified, which means one of the current Service which was **NOT
OPERATIONAL** is changed to **OPERATIONAL**

![ArjunMenon_3-1637745741115.jpeg](images/ArjunMenon_3-1637745741115.jpeg)
 

![ArjunMenon_4-1637745741165.jpeg](images/ArjunMenon_4-1637745741165.jpeg)

## PowerShell Scripts

As mentioned above, in my case, I have used PowerShell for scripting the
requirement. You can access the scripts which I have used from below.

### Complete Script - Easily understandable

Below script is the similar implementation of the Production Read
Script.
Rather than using PowerShell piping, we are using conventional For-Each
so that script is easily readable.
 
```bash
#Check the Login Status
$LoginStatus = m365 status

if($LoginStatus -Match "Logged out"){
    #Exiting the execution
    exit;
}

$webURL = "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/HealthStatusSite"
$listName = "O365 Health Status"
$workLoads = m365 tenant status list --query "value[?Status != 'ServiceOperational']"  --output json  | ConvertFrom-Json
$currentOutageServices = (m365 spo listitem list --webUrl $webURL --title $listName --fields "Title, Workload, Id"  --output json).Replace("ID", "_ID") | ConvertFrom-Json

Foreach ($workload in $workLoads){
    if($workload.Workload -notin $currentOutageServices.Workload){
        $addedWorkLoad = m365 spo listitem add --webUrl $webURL --listTitle $listName --contentType Item --Title $workload.WorkloadDisplayName --Workload $workload.Workload --FirstIdentifiedDate (Get-Date -Date $workload.StatusTime -Format "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm") --WorkflowJSONData (Out-String -InputObject $workload -Width 100)

        #Send notification using CLI Commands
        m365 outlook mail send --to "arjun@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" --subject "Outage Reported in $($workload.WorkloadDisplayName)" --bodyContents "Any outage has been reported for the Service : $($workload.WorkloadDisplayName) <a href='https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/HealthStatusSite/Lists/O365%20Health%20Status'>Access the Health Status List</a>" --bodyContentType HTML
    }
}

#Updating the status to IsInOutage to NO the list item if the service is back to normal
Foreach ($currentOutageService in $currentOutageServices){
    if($currentOutageService.Workload -notin $workLoads.Workload){
        $RemovedRecord = m365 spo listitem remove --webUrl $webURL --listTitle $listName --id  $currentOutageService.Id

        #Send notification using CLI Commands
        m365 outlook mail send --to "arjun@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" --subject "Outage RESOLVED for $($currentOutageService.WorkloadDisplayName)" --bodyContents "Outage which was reported for the Service : $($workload.WorkloadDisplayName) is RESOLVED." --bodyContentType HTML
    }
}
```

### Simple Script - Production Ready (Lines of Code : 4)

In the below script, I have used PowerShell piping and hence the script
may look complicated. But it hardly has 3 lines of code which does the
complete operation and these kind of scripts will be ideal for your
production like environment. If you need to understand the script, you
can view easily understandable
script.
 
 
```bash
$webURL = "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/M365HealthStatus"
$listName = "O365 Health Status"
$workLoads = m365 tenant status list --query "value[?Status != 'ServiceOperational']"  --output json  | ConvertFrom-Json
$currentOutageServices = (m365 spo listitem list --webUrl $webURL --title $listName --fields "Title, Workload, Id"  --output json).Replace("ID", "_ID") | ConvertFrom-Json
$workLoads | ?{$_.Workload -notin $currentOutageServices.Workload} | %{ $addedWorkLoad = m365 spo listitem add --webUrl $webURL --listTitle $listName --contentType Item --Title $_.WorkloadDisplayName --Workload $_.Workload --FirstIdentifiedDate (Get-Date -Date $_.StatusTime -Format "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm") --WorkflowJSONData (Out-String -InputObject $_ -Width 100)}
$currentOutageServices | ?{$_.Workload -notin $workLoads.Workload} | %{ $UpdatedWorkflod = m365 spo listitem set --webUrl $webURL --listTitle $listName --contentType Item --id  $_.Id --StillinOutage "false" }
```
 
 
## Schedule the script

The last part of the solution is to schedule the script which we have
created. In my case, I have scheduled the script to run every half an
hour. Schedule could be decided depending on your business case.

In my case, since I am using a Windows machine and hence I would be
using PowerShell as my scripting tool. Since CLI for Microsoft 365 is OS
agnostic, you are free to use script based on your Operating System, be
it on Windows or Mac OS or Linux.

In this blog, we will not be covering about scheduling the scripts in
PowerShell since it is a straight forward activity. You can view [this
blog](https://o365reports.com/2019/08/02/schedule-powershell-script-task-scheduler/) where
it has explained how to configure PowerShell


## Complete Scripts

Too lazy to build scripts. Don't worry. We got your back. Now the
complete script package is available in the CLI for Microsoft
365 [sample scripts
section](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/sample-scripts/tenant/monitor-notify-healthstatus/).
