## üóíÔ∏è SharePoint Framework Toolkit - Rapid progress!

Since its initial release, SPFx Toolkit has expanded its capabilities significantly. What started as a simple extension to support creating ACEs to customize the Viva Connections Dashboard kicked off to a Toolkit that supports every stage of SPFx development. From the very beginning when you are just learning and creating your solution, to developing, delivering with CI/CD pipelines, and managing your solutions. Now SPFx Toolkit has also entered the AI era, providing you with more capabilities to manage your SharePoint Online Tenant directly from within GitHub Copilot Agent experience. Over the past two years, this product has almost tripled in features and capabilities.
Just check out the features list üëá

Now we are excited to announce that two new maintainers have joined the team: **Nico De Cleyre** and **Saurabh Tripathi**. With their expertise and dedication, we are confident that the toolkit will continue to evolve and provide even more value to developers in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

## Nico De Cleyre in his own words

My career began in an unexpected way, during a holiday job repairing lotto machines across Belgium. A simple question changed everything: Were they still looking for employees in their consultancy department? When they asked if I knew SharePoint, I had no answer. But with a quick Google search, I was determined to find out. That curiosity led me to start as a SharePoint developer, where I did dangerous things in the GAC üòú. Fast forward many years, and today, I am a Microsoft 365 architect at ConXioN. What defines me is the constant pursuit of knowledge - investing, searching, discovering new technologies. This  curiosity has shaped me into an all-rounder with deep expertise across the M365 ecosystem.

The Microsoft PnP community was never unfamiliar to me. Yet, for a long time, I stood on the sidelines, held back by the imposter syndrome. But a few years back I chose to take the step and started contributing actively to PnP Open-source projects. I quickly realized that my contributions didn't just benefit the community, I gained knowledge, new perspectives and a deeper connection with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem in return.

Outside of work I am a proud married father of 2 daughters and cherish every moment I can spend with my family. I enjoy gardening and caring for & loving our animals. With 4 dogs, 2 cats, 4 chickens, 2 rabbits and a water turtle you could say I am somewhat of an animal lover ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Saurabh Tripathi in his own words

I am a M365 Developer and currently working as a Solutions Architect at AFRY. I have done all kinds of work with SharePoint but have always been a Developer at heart since the beginning. A lot of my work has been on SharePoint on-prem, and I used to proudly say, "It is purely for storage, but you would never know if it's SharePoint just by looking at it." 
With M365, I had been quietly taking inspiration from the PnP community in my day to day work, until one day I heard someone cool say, "Why not contribute to the tools you use every day?" That really resonated with me, and since then, I look for opportunities to contribute whenever I can.

Outside of work, I am a stay-at-home, spend-time-with-family kind of guy. Also, I love a good workout and can't go long without one.

## Achieve more together

We are excited to have Nico and Saurabh on board as maintainers of the SharePoint Framework Toolkit. Their expertise and passion for the Microsoft 365 ecosystem will undoubtedly help us continue to improve and expand the toolkit, making it an even more valuable resource for developers.
We are also grateful to all the contributors who have supported the toolkit so far. Your contributions have been invaluable in shaping the toolkit into what it is today. We look forward to continuing this journey together and achieving even more in the future.
The SharePoint Framework Toolkit is a community-driven project, and we encourage everyone to get involved. Whether you're a developer, designer, or just someone who loves Microsoft 365, there are many ways you can contribute to the toolkit. From reporting bugs and suggesting new features to writing documentation and creating tutorials, your input is always welcome.
We believe that by working together, we can create a toolkit that truly meets the needs of the community and helps developers be more productive in their work.
