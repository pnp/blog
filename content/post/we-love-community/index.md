## Community rocks

Our goal in the Microsoft 365 platform community (PnP) is to help everyone to extend Microsoft 365 and we offer free support as in 

- sample galleries
- tools
- blog posts
- community calls
- podcasts

to provide you with inspiration, examples and guidance. We strongly believe in our community as a global movement to achieve more together. As there is always room for improvement, we came up with the idea to promote your samples on social media even more.

## Show us what you build

## What's in it for you?

### Exposure

Even if you already shared your samples somewhere, we want to give them more visibility and exposure in the [Unified Sample gallery at adoption.microsoft.com](https://adoption.microsoft.com/sample-solution-gallery). We will promote your samples on Twitter and LinkedIn.

### Recognition

We also want to celebrate your contributions towards community and recognize your efforts. For our community [recognition program](https://pnp.github.io/recognitionprogram/) we partnered with [Credly](https://www.credly.com/organizations/m365pnp/badges) to create prestigious digital badges that you can proudly display on your website, social media profiles, and your resume. Contributors to the Microsoft 365 platform community (PnP) earn these badges, that will appear along with other professional accreditations - like the Microsoft certifications and many others.

### Networking

Are you looking into pursuing to be awarded as a Microsoft [Most Valuable professional (MVP)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/)? All your contributions count and you will get to know people who may help and guide you in this journey. 

## Not sure where to start?

If you would love to share your work, but are not familiar with GitHub or how contributing works in general, we will guide you in our [Sharing Is Caring](https://pnp.github.io/sharing-is-caring/) initiative, where we provide you with hands-on guidance. We are all here and happy to help!
