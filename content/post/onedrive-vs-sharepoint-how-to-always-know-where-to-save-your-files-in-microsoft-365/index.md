# OneDrive vs SharePoint: How to Always Know Where to Save Your Files in Microsoft 365
If you’re new to Microsoft 365, one of the first (and most common) questions you’ll run into is surprisingly simple:

**“Where should I save this file?”**

You click **Save**, you see options like OneDrive and SharePoint, and suddenly you’re unsure:

- Is this file only visible to me?

- Can my team see it?

- What happens if I leave the company?

You’re not alone. This confusion is one of the most frequent pain points for new joiners—and even experienced users.

Microsoft didn’t make this easy. OneDrive and SharePoint look similar, they both store files, and they both sync to your computer. **But choosing the wrong one has real consequences**:

- Files get scattered across personal drives

- Links break when people leave

- Teams waste time searching for the “latest version”

The goal of this guide is simple:
👉 **By the end of this article, you’ll know exactly which button to click—every time.**

## The Office Analogy (This Changes Everything)
Before we get technical, let’s imagine a physical office. This analogy makes everything click.

- **OneDrive is your desk or backpack**
It’s personal. You have the only key. You can be messy here. Nobody can see what’s inside unless you explicitly invite them.

- **SharePoint is the office filing cabinet**
It sits in the hallway. The whole team has access. This is where finished, important work lives—things the team relies on.

You wouldn’t store your half-finished notes or personal paperwork in the shared filing cabinet.
And you wouldn’t lock official team documents in your backpack.

That’s the core idea.

## Section A: OneDrive — The “Me” Space
**OneDrive is your private workspace in the cloud.**
Think of it as My Documents, but accessible from anywhere.

### What OneDrive Is
By default, everything in OneDrive is private. Only you can see it unless you explicitly share a file or folder.

This is the place for **“Me” work**.

### Best Use Cases for OneDrive
- **Rough drafts**
Early versions of documents that are messy, incomplete, and constantly changing.

- **Personal admin**
Performance reviews, expense claims, personal development notes.

- **Individual tasks**
Templates you’re building for yourself, notes you don’t need to share.

### Real-World Scenario
You’re drafting a proposal for a client. You’re still figuring out the structure, rewriting sections, and deleting paragraphs.
👉 This belongs in **OneDrive**.

### Key Takeaway
OneDrive is **attached to you**.
If you change roles or leave the company, these files may be archived or deleted with your account.

**If the team needs a file to do their job, it does not belong in OneDrive.**

## Section B: SharePoint — The “We” Space
**SharePoint is where teams and the organisation work together.**

**What SharePoint Is**
Files in SharePoint belong to a **team, project, or department**, not an individual.
They are accessible to everyone who needs them and remain in place regardless of staff changes.

This is the place for **“We” work**.

### Best Use Cases for SharePoint
- **Official documents**
Policies, procedures, employee handbooks.

- **Shared resources**
Contract templates, brand assets, reusable documents.

- **Team projects**
Files that need structure, version control, and long-term ownership.

### Real-World Scenario
Your team finalises a project plan that multiple people will update and reference over the next year.
👉 This belongs in **SharePoint**.

### Key Takeaway
If you leave the company, **SharePoint files stay exactly where they are**.
The business continues without broken links or lost knowledge.

## The Document Lifecycle: How OneDrive and SharePoint Work Together
The biggest mistake users make is thinking they must choose **either** OneDrive **or** SharePoint.

In reality, they work together.

### The Story of a File
- **Drafting (OneDrive)**
You start a new document in OneDrive. It’s private, messy, and evolving.

- **The Hand-off (Move to SharePoint)**
The draft is ready for feedback. You move it into a SharePoint document library (often via a Teams channel).

- **Publishing (SharePoint)**
The team collaborates, reviews, and finalises the document.
It now lives permanently in SharePoint as the official version.

This workflow is intentional—and powerful when used correctly.

### The Cheat Sheet: Decide in 5 Seconds
Before you save a file, ask yourself these three questions:

**Is this file just for me?**
→ **OneDrive** (“Me” space)

**Is this a draft I’m not ready to share yet?**
→ **OneDrive**(personal draft)

**Does the team need to edit or rely on this file?**
→ **SharePoint** (“We” space)

If you follow this checklist, you’ll almost never get it wrong.

### Why This Matters (More Than You Think)
When organisations don’t follow this model:

- Knowledge walks out the door when people leave

- Teams duplicate work because they can’t find files

- Trust in “the latest version” disappears

When they do:

- Collaboration is smoother

- Files are easy to find

- The business retains its knowledge

This isn’t just about storage—it’s about **working better together**.

### Conclusion: The “Me vs We” Rule
If you remember only one thing, remember this:

- **If the file is about you** — your draft, your notes, your review — keep it in your digital backpack (**OneDrive**).

- **If the file is about us** — our project, our policy, our client — put it in the office filing cabinet (**SharePoint**).

Follow the **Me vs We rule**, and you’ll always know exactly where to save your files—and you’ll help your team collaborate better without even trying.
