SharePoint Online gives possibility to manage permissions on many different levels: webs, lists, folders, files, items. Breaking role inheritance may not always be the best idea to do and should rather be considered as last resort, but it is not always possible to create an enterprise, tailor-made, solution without it. Thanks to awesome work done by the community, CLI for Microsoft 365 now has new commands which will allow us to accomplish that.

## ü§î But first of all what is CLI for Microsoft 365? Quick intro

If you already know what CLI for M365 is then I suppose you may skip this partüòÄ. CLI for Microsoft 365 is a cross platform command line tool based on Node.js that helps you manage many things around Microsoft 365 and your SPFx projects (yes, that as well ü§©. rename, upgrade ... you name it). To name a few, you may manage OneDrive, Planner, Power Apps and Automate, Teams, Yammer, SharePoint (of course). The list keeps on growing and growing, [check out the CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/). But it's not only about managing Microsoft 365. The CLI helps you also manage your own SPFx environment (check out the [doctor](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spfx/spfx-doctor/)) or projects (rename, upgrade etc.). This is very unique that many similar command line tools don't have. Some commands do simple things but some actually are ready to use scenarios all done under a single command. Check out the full list of [commands](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/login/#usage)

## üéöÔ∏è Permission Levels

It all starts with defining what roles (permission levels) you will want to use. Each SharePoint site starts with a set of default role definitions like: Full Control, Design, Edit, Contribute, Read. Those are the basic role definitions needed for most use cases we may think of but if something is missing then SharePoint gives us the possibility to extend permission levels with our custom made role definitions with different set of permissions we may give, grouped in list, site, personal permissions. Exactly this scenario is covered by first set of commands now available in CLI for Microsoft 365. We may use

```
spo roledefinition list/get/add/remove
```

commands to do everything we need in this area. When adding a new role definition we may pick any set of permissions from the following list

```
EmptyMask, ViewListItems, AddListItems, EditListItems, DeleteListItems, ApproveItems, OpenItems, ViewVersions, DeleteVersions, CancelCheckout, ManagePersonalViews, ManageLists, ViewFormPages, AnonymousSearchAccessList, Open, ViewPages, AddAndCustomizePages, ApplyThemeAndBorder, ApplyStyleSheets, ViewUsageData, CreateSSCSite, ManageSubwebs, CreateGroups, ManagePermissions, BrowseDirectories, BrowseUserInfo, AddDelPrivateWebParts, UpdatePersonalWebParts, ManageWeb, AnonymousSearchAccessWebLists, UseClientIntegration, UseRemoteAPIs, ManageAlerts, CreateAlerts, EditMyUserInfo, EnumeratePermissions, FullMask
``` 

in the `rights` option.

What's worth mentioning is also the additional info (value) added when retrieving role definitions. CLI for Microsoft 365 when retreiving data usually outputs the response of the used API endpoint. For the role definition the output unfortonatly is not that user friendly.
Lets check what SharePoint REST API gives when retreiving a custom created role defintion:

```
{
  "BasePermissions": {
    "High": "0",
    "Low": "67567639"
  },
  "Description": "",
  "Hidden": false,
  "Id": 1073741934,
  "Name": "test",
  "Order": 2147483647,
  "RoleTypeKind": 0,
}
```

Wait, what? so what exactly are the permissions given for that role definiton? What does `67567639` mean ü§î? Luckly for us CLI does the additional translation and adds this info. For the above response when running

```
m365 spo roledefinition get --webUrl https://someTenant.sharepoint.com/sites/someSite --id 1073741934
```

we will get

```
{
  "BasePermissions": {
    "High": "0",
    "Low": "67567639"
  },
  "Description": "",
  "Hidden": false,
  "Id": 1073741934,
  "Name": "test",
  "Order": 2147483647,
  "RoleTypeKind": 0,
  "BasePermissionsValue": [
    "ViewListItems",
    "AddListItems",
    "EditListItems",
    "ApproveItems",
    "Open",
    "ViewPages",
    "AddAndCustomizePages",
    "BrowseDirectories"
  ],
  "RoleTypeKindValue": "None"
}
```

Now... ok.. now I get it üòâ.

For more information check out the following commands:

- [`spo roledefinition get`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/roledefinition/roledefinition-get/) - Gets specified role definition from web
- [`spo roledefinition list`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/roledefinition/roledefinition-list/) - Gets list of role definitions for the specified site
- [`spo roledefinition add`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/roledefinition/roledefinition-add/) - Adds a new roledefinition to web
- [`spo roledefinition remove`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/roledefinition/roledefinition-remove/) - Removes the role definition from the specified site

## üîìüîí Roleinheritance break/reset

The most advance secure scenarios sooner or later will require providing some unique permissions on list, folder, item or file level. It's best to alwasy inherit permissions as long as possible and when breaking the inheritance be aware of the [limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/troubleshoot/lists-and-libraries/error-share-break-inheritance). CLI for Microsoft 365 has now set of commands you may use on any level that will allow you to either break or reset role inhertiance. When breaking role inheritance the currently defined permissions will be kept. In order to clear all exsiting permissions we may use `clearExistingPermissions` option.

For more information check the docs for the following commands:

- [`spo file roleinheritance break`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/file/file-roleinheritance-break/)
- [`spo file roleinheritance reset`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/file/file-roleinheritance-reset/)
- [`spo folder roleinheritance break`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/folder/folder-roleinheritance-break/)
- [`spo folder roleinheritance reset`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/folder/folder-roleinheritance-reset/)
- [`spo list roleinheritance break`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/list/list-roleinheritance-break/)
- [`spo list roleinheritance reset`](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/list/list-roleinheritance-reset/)
