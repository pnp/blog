The SharePoint PnP Community monthly call is our general monthly review
of the latest SharePoint and Microsoft 365 PnP topics (news, tools,
extensions, features, capabilities, content and training), engineering
priorities and community recognition for Developers, IT Pros and
Makers.  This monthly community call happens on the second Tuesday of
each month. You can download recurrent invite

## Call summary

If you're looking at this blog post, then you are at the new Microsoft
365 PnP Community hub at Microsoft Tech Communities!  Please take a
moment to look around. The [Microsoft 365 Update - Community (PnP) |
March
2021](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/microsoft-365-community-pnp-march-2021-update/ba-p/2188616)is
available. In this call, the Top 10 developer and non-developer entries
in UserVoice are reviewed and top engineering priorities identified.  
Your votes do influence engineering priorities.  You are invited to
attend the growing list of [Sharing is
Caring](https://pnp.github.io/sharing-is-caring/) events.  Register
today.  In [Episode 117 of PnP
Weekly](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/microsoft-365-pnp-weekly-episode-117/ba-p/2193707)
tools and approaches for simplifying the move from Classic to Modern,
on-prem to cloud were discussed.  Why Modern?  Well, one reason -- Viva
capabilities like the one that will be demonstrated today are available
only in Modern.  Testing of SPFx v1.12 is on the final stretch.  Release
expected any day.  
Thank you to the 200 + active contributors and organizations actively
participating in this PnP Community during February. You are truly
amazing.  The host of this call was [Vesa

Q&A took place in the chat throughout the call.
 

**Demo: Getting started with Microsoft Viva Topics** -- system and tools
to help customers manage knowledge within their organizations through a
conscious AI assisted strategy of connecting people and actionable
