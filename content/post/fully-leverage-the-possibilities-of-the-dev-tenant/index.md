Now let's imagine this. You have the developer tenant from your
Microsoft 365 Developer Subscription, and you enrolled the [Power Apps
Community
Plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/communityplan/) with it, so
you have the full range of possibilities on your dev tenant, right? 
 
Not quite. 
 
Yes, you have access to Dataverse now and yes, you can even use premium
connectors and that's cool. But you can go one step further.

The Power Apps Community Plan gives you a Development Environment and
you can add even more Trial Environments on your dev tenant. But you
can't set up new Production Environments.  
 
## What are Production Environments and why do you want one?

Production Environments are used for your daily business with production
data. If your organization is spread over multiple countries or even
continents, it makes sense to give every country its own production
environment. Production Environments are backed up frequently to protect
your data.  
But on your dev tenant you don't need one, right? Because you're just
testing out and learning things, correct? Well yes, but what if you want
to learn how to set up a staging environment for your
organization, where you have the recommended environments?

1. Development
2. Testing 
3. Production 

And imagine you want to learn how to set up the correct security roles
in Azure to test things out. You can't do that on your regular dev
tenant, because you are not allowed to set up more environments
(especially Production Environments).  
Many users are simply not allowed to get full control in
the organizations they're working for, because of security and
compliance reasons.  
So, what to do? 
Wouldn't it be cool, if you could get a Power Apps Standalone license
for your dev tenant? Sure, that costs money but you would have it all: 

-   A Microsoft 365 E5 license 
-   Multiple environments to plan out real-life scenarios for
    your organization 
-   Dummy users, mailboxes and SharePoint sites to test your flows
    and apps 
-   Premium connectors  
-   Access to Dataverse 


And guess what? You can actually purchase a Power Apps standalone
license for your dev tenant! You are capable to build a complete safe
tenant to test, learn and grow for your organization with just the cost
of the Power Apps license.  
 
## Here is how you do it

Log into your dev tenant and go to the Admin center. Select 
the **waffle menu** in the upper left corner and select  **Admin.** 
![Gezeitenbrand42_10-1614283053396.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_10-1614283053396.png)
 
 

Next, select  **Purchase services**. 


![Gezeitenbrand42_11-1614283053399.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_11-1614283053399.png)
 
 
In the category Business apps you find all the Power Platform plans. In
this example I highlighted the Power Apps per user plan, but you can
also go for the Power Automate per user plan (it's way cheaper and you
have very similar possibilities. Remember, you just want to create
different environments and you can do that with both plans. Then click
on **Details** to see, what's included. 
![Gezeitenbrand42_12-1614283053411.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_12-1614283053411.png)
 
 
 
In the next screen you can check all the details. Select  **Included
apps** to see every detail. If you're happy with it click
on **Purchase**. 
 
Now Now
![Gezeitenbrand42_13-1614283053413.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_13-1614283053413.png)
 
 
Now you're almost done. You already are at the Checkout. Fill in
your postal address and your billing information. After that click
on **Place order**. 
 
![Gezeitenbrand42_14-1614283053403.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_14-1614283053403.png)
 
 
After a few minutes you will get your confirmation mail.  
![Gezeitenbrand42_15-1614283053406.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_15-1614283053406.png)
 
 
If you select  **Get started** you will be transferred to the Your
products section of the Admin center. Select  **Assign licenses**. 
![Gezeitenbrand42_16-1614283053415.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_16-1614283053415.png)
 
 
![Gezeitenbrand42_17-1614283053416.png](images/Gezeitenbrand42_17-1614283053416.png)
 
 
For whatever reasons, you have to select  Assign licenses once again.  
After that you can type in a name and select  the chevron icon next to
Turn apps and services on or off. Check all the apps and services you
want to assign, then finish the process by clicking on Assign again, on
the bottom of the page.

BOOM, there you go.

As described in my previous post [*How to enhance your "dev tenant" to
unleash the full potential of the Power
Platform*](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/how-to-enhance-your-dev-tenant-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of/ba-p/2158336),
you can now add multiple environments and yes, even Production
Environments. Check out the [Microsoft documentation about
environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-environment) to
get more details and why and how to use them. Enjoy.
