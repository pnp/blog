Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) is a useful addition to pages where you need to display common requests. The FAQ Web Part can be added to a page as a straight list of questions and answers or a series of grouped questions and answers when the need for a more organized approach is required.

The FAQ Web Part is not only for questions and answers — it can be used for any content that lends itself to expanding/collapsing functionality, such as keywords and definitions or expanding on short phrases.

In my latest community sample, I built an SPFx web part to provide an ability to display FAQs as Accordion or Tab.

Here is how it looks:
