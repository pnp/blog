State management is essential for creating dynamic and interactive components in SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions. While `useState` is a popular choice for managing state in React-based SPFx web parts, `useReducer` is better when the state logic becomes more complex. This article demonstrates the advantages of `useReducer` in SPFx solutions using a counter example, highlighting its power and flexibility.

[SPFx React useReducer Hook Sample](https://github.com/ahmad-jad-alhak/spfx-react-usereducer-hook-sample)

### **Why State Management Matters in SPFx**

Imagine you’re building a web part that fetches data from multiple SharePoint lists. Managing the loading states, errors, and fetched data can quickly become messy, especially as your logic expands. Without a centralized approach, it’s easy to lose track of updates, causing bugs and inconsistencies. This is where `useReducer` shines—it centralizes state transitions and simplifies managing complex workflows.

### What is `useReducer` Hook?

The `useReducer` hook is a React hook that lets you manage state with a reducer function. This function decides how the state should change in response to specific actions. This method is particularly helpful in SPFx solutions where state transitions are complex or need a centralized approach.

For more details on `useReducer`, check out the official [React documentation.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)

Syntax:

```typescript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

* `reducer`: A function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.
    
* `initialState`: The initial value of the state.
    
* `dispatch`: A function to send actions to the reducer.
    

# Comparing Approaches: useState vs. useReducer

To understand the benefits of `useReducer`, let’s build a simple counter web part using SPFx. We’ll compare this approach to a `useState` implementation to highlight why `useReducer` is a better choice for certain scenarios.

These benefits make `useReducer` a powerful tool for managing state in applications where state logic is complex or needs to be shared across components.

### Using Multiple `useState` Hooks

When using `useState` for complex state logic, you might end up with something like the following:

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const CounterWithUseState: React.FC = () => {
  
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [isEven, setIsEven] = useState(true);
    
  // Function to increment the count
  const increment = () => {
    const newCount = count + 1; // Increment the count by 1
    setCount(newCount); // Update the `count` state
    setIsEven(newCount % 2 === 0); // Update the `isEven` state based on the new count
  };

  // Function to decrement the count
  const decrement = () => {
    const newCount = count - 1; // Decrement the count by 1
    setCount(newCount); // Update the `count` state
    setIsEven(newCount % 2 === 0); // Update the `isEven` state based on the new count
  };

  // Function to reset the count and parity
  const reset = () => {
    setCount(0); // Reset the count to 0
    setIsEven(true); // Reset `isEven` to true since 0 is even
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display the current count */}
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>

      {/* Display whether the count is even or odd */}
      <p>{isEven ? 'Even' : 'Odd'}</p>

      {/* Button to increment the count */}
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>

      {/* Button to decrement the count */}
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>

      {/* Button to reset the count */}
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterWithUseState;
```

Challenges with the useState Approach:

* **Scattered Updates:**  
    Using separate hooks for related state (e.g., `count` and `isEven`) requires multiple coordinated updates, leading to potential errors.
    
* **Scalability Challenges:**  
    As you add new actions (like "double") or more state variables, the logic becomes more complex and error-prone.
    
* **Manual Synchronization:**  
    Maintaining state consistency (updating `isEven` every time `count` changes) can easily lead to mistakes when adding more related states.
    
* **Distributed Logic:**  
    New functionalities require spreading update logic across multiple setter calls, reducing code clarity.
    

### Using the useReducer Approach

By centralizing state updates in one reducer function, you gain clarity and scalability. Consider the following example which manages a counter’s value and parity, including an additional "double" action.

File → `counterReducer.ts`

```typescript
// reducers/counterReducer.ts

// Define the structure of the state
export interface CounterState {
  count: number;
  isEven: boolean;
}

// Define the structure of the actions
export interface CounterAction {
  type: 'INCREMENT' | 'DECREMENT' | 'RESET' | 'DOUBLE';
}

// Define the initial state
export const initialState: CounterState = {
  count: 0,
  isEven: true,
};

// Reducer function to manage state transitions
export const counterReducer = (state: CounterState, action: CounterAction): CounterState => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT': {
      const newCount = state.count + 1;
      return {
        count: newCount,
        isEven: newCount % 2 === 0,
      };
    }
    case 'DECREMENT': {
      const newCount = state.count - 1;
      return {
        count: newCount,
        isEven: newCount % 2 === 0,
      };
    }
    case 'RESET': {
      return initialState;
    }
    case 'DOUBLE': {
      const newCount = state.count * 2;
      return {
        count: newCount,
        isEven: newCount % 2 === 0,
      };
    }
    default:
      return state; // Return unchanged state for unrecognized actions
  }
};
```

File →`CounterWithUseReducer.tsx`

```typescript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
import { counterReducer, initialState } from '../reducers/counterReducer';

const CounterWithUseReducer: React.FC = () => {
  // Initialize the state and dispatch function using useReducer
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
      <p>{state.isEven ? 'Even' : 'Odd'}</p>

      {/* Button to increment the count */}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>

      {/* Button to decrement the count */}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>Decrement</button>

      {/* Button to reset the count */}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'RESET' })}>Reset</button>

      {/* Button to double the count */}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DOUBLE' })}>Double</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterWithUseReducer;
```

Benefits of the `useReducer` Approach

1. **Centralized State Updates**  
    With a reducer, all logic for updating `count` and `isEven` is encapsulated in one place. This makes it easier to reason about how the state changes on each action.
    
2. **Easier to Add New Actions**  
    To add a new action, you simply extend the action type and handle it in the reducer. There’s no need to sprinkle additional `setState` calls in different places.
    
3. **Improved Readability**  
    Having a single reducer function that describes all possible state changes keeps your component simpler and more predictable.
    
4. **Scales Better for Complex State**  
    As your application grows, a reducer-based approach often becomes more maintainable than using multiple `useState` hooks for closely related pieces of state.
    

# Handling Data Fetching in SPFx with useState vs. useReducer

For growing SPFx projects, `useReducer` provides a structured approach to state transitions, keeping components clean and logic straightforward. Below is an example using `useState` to fetch and display SharePoint list items.

#### **Example: Using** `useState` for Fetching Items

Below is an example of using `useState` to fetch and display SharePoint list items:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import styles from './ReactUseReducerHookBasic.module.scss';
import { IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps } from './IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps';
import { initialState, listReducer } from '../reducers/listReducer';
import { spfi, SPFx } from '@pnp/sp';
import '@pnp/sp/webs';
import '@pnp/sp/lists';
import '@pnp/sp/items';

const ReactUseReducerHookBasic: React.FC<IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps> = ({ listName }) => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const fetchItems = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);

    try {
      const fetchedItems = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(listName).items();
      setItems(fetchedItems);
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to fetch items');
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchItems();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</p>}
      <ul>
        {items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.Id}>{item.Title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ReactUseReducerHookBasic;
```

#### Challenges with `useState`:

* Managing multiple, related states (e.g., `loading`, `error`, `items`) can become **tedious** and error-prone.
    
* State transitions are scattered across multiple setter calls, making logic harder to follow.
    
* Adding new state-related actions (e.g., pagination or retry logic) increases complexity.
    

### Example: Using useReducer for Fetching Items

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import styles from './ReactUseReducerHookBasic.module.scss';
import { IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps } from './IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps';
import { initialState, listReducer } from '../reducers/listReducer';
import { spfi, SPFx } from '@pnp/sp';
import '@pnp/sp/webs';
import '@pnp/sp/lists';
import '@pnp/sp/items';

// Define action types
const FETCH_START = 'FETCH_START';
const FETCH_SUCCESS = 'FETCH_SUCCESS';
const FETCH_ERROR = 'FETCH_ERROR';

// Define the initial state
const initialState = {
  items: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
};

// Define the reducer
const listReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case FETCH_START:
      return { ...state, loading: true, error: null };
    case FETCH_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, loading: false, items: action.payload };
    case FETCH_ERROR:
      return { ...state, loading: false, error: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const ReactUseReducerHookBasic: React.FC<IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps> = ({ listName }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(listReducer, initialState);

  const fetchItems = async () => {
    dispatch({ type: FETCH_START });

    try {
      const fetchedItems = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(listName).items();
      dispatch({ type: FETCH_SUCCESS, payload: fetchedItems });
    } catch (err) {
      dispatch({ type: FETCH_ERROR, payload: 'Failed to fetch items' });
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchItems();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {state.loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {state.error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{state.error}</p>}
      <ul>
        {state.items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.Id}>{item.Title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ReactUseReducerHookBasic;
```

Below is an example using `useReducer` with PnP.js to fetch items in an SPFx context. All state transitions are handled in one place (the **reducer**), making it easier to **modify** and **debug**.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing `useReducer` with PnPjs and Creating the Folder Structure

This guide will walk you through the process of implementing a `useReducer`\-based state management system and organizing your project with a clean, scalable folder structure.

### **Step 1: Set Up SPFx Web Part**

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt** Navigate to the folder where you want to create your project.
    
2. **Run the Yeoman SharePoint Generator**
    
    ```bash
    yo @microsoft/sharepoint
    ```
    
3. **Answer the Prompts:**
    
    * **Solution Name:** (e.g., `ReactUseReducerHookBasic`).
        
    * **Baseline Packages:** Select **SharePoint Online only (latest)**.
        
    * **Folder Location:** Select **Use the current folder**.
        
    * **Component Type:** Choose **WebPart**.
        
    * **WebPart Name:** (e.g., `ReactUseReducerHookBasic`).
        
    * **Framework:** Choose **React**.
        
4. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
    
    ```bash
    cd ReactUseReducerHookBasic
    ```
    
5. **Install PnP.js Libraries:**
    
    ```bash
    npm install @pnp/sp @pnp/logging
    ```
    
6. **Start the Local Development Server:**
    
    ```bash
    gulp serve
    ```
    
    This will open the **SharePoint Workbench** in your browser, where you can preview your web part.
    

### **Step 2: Implement the Reducer Logic**

#### Folder Structure

Create  the following folders and files: Organize your project to maintain clean separation of concerns:

```bash
ReactUseReducerHookBasic/
├── src/
│   ├── webparts/
│   │   └── ReactUseReducerHookBasic/
│   │       ├── components/                 # UI Components
│   │       │   ├── ReactUseReducerHookBasic.tsx  # Main React Component
│   │       │   └── ReactUseReducerHookBasic.module.scss  # Component Styles
│   │       ├── state/                      # State management logic
│   │       │   ├── actions/                # Action types and creators
│   │       │   │   └── listActionsTypes.ts # Action types for list fetching
│   │       │   ├── reducers/               # Reducer logic and initial states
│   │       │   │   ├── listReducer.ts      # Reducer for managing list state
│   │       │   │   ├── initialStates.ts    # Initial state for reducers
│   │       │   └── index.ts                # Re-export reducers and actions
│   │       ├── ReactUseReducerHookBasicWebPart.ts  # WebPart entry file
│   │       └── index.ts                    # WebPart index file
```

1. #### Define Action Types
    
    Create `src/webparts/ReactUseReducerHookBasic /state/actions/listActionsTypes.ts` to define action types and their structure:
    
2. ```typescript
               //  src/webparts/ReactUseReducerHookBasic/state/actions/listActionsTypes.ts
               
               // Action types for list state management
               export const FETCH_START = 'FETCH_START';
               export const FETCH_SUCCESS = 'FETCH_SUCCESS';
               export const FETCH_ERROR = 'FETCH_ERROR';
               
               // Action type definitions
               export type ListAction =
                 | { type: typeof FETCH_START }
                 | { type: typeof FETCH_SUCCESS; payload: any[] }
                 | { type: typeof FETCH_ERROR; payload: string };
    ```
    
3. Create the Reducer
    
    In `src/state/reducers/listReducer.ts`, implement the reducer logic:
    
    ```typescript
    //  src/webparts/ReactUseReducerHookBasic/state/reducers/listReducer.ts
    
    import { ListAction, FETCH_START, FETCH_SUCCESS, FETCH_ERROR } from '../actions/listActionsTypes';
    
    export interface ListState {
      items: any[];
      loading: boolean;
      error: string | null;
    }
    
    export const initialState: ListState = {
      items: [],
      loading: false,
      error: null,
    };
    
    export const listReducer = (state: ListState, action: ListAction): ListState => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case FETCH_START:
          return { ...state, loading: true, error: null };
        case FETCH_SUCCESS:
          return { ...state, loading: false, items: action.payload };
        case FETCH_ERROR:
          return { ...state, loading: false, error: action.payload };
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };
    ```
    
4. Re-export State Files
    
    In `src/state/index.ts`, re-export all reducers and actions for better imports:
    
    ```typescript
    // src/webparts/ReactUseReducerHookBasic/state/inedx.ts
    
    export * from './actions/listActionsTypes';
    export * from './reducers/listReducer';
    ```
    
    ### **Step 3: Use the Reducer in the Component**
    
    In `src/webparts/ReactUseReducerHookBasic/components/ReactUseReducerHookBasic.tsx`, integrate the reducer and implement the fetching logic:
    
    ```typescript
    // src/webparts/ReactUseReducerHookBasic/components/ReactUseReducerHookBasic.tsx
    
    import * as React from 'react';
    import styles from './ReactUseReducerHookBasic.module.scss';
    import { IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps } from './IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps';
    import { initialState, listReducer } from '../reducers/listReducer';
    import { spfi, SPFx } from '@pnp/sp';
    import '@pnp/sp/webs';
    import '@pnp/sp/lists';
    import '@pnp/sp/items';
    
    const ReactUseReducerHookBasic: React.FC<IReactUseReducerHookBasicProps> = ({ listName }) => {
      // Initialize our state and dispatch from the reducer
      const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(listReducer, initialState);
    
      /**
       * Asynchronous function to fetch items from the specified SharePoint list.
       * Dispatches actions to manage loading, success, and error states.
       */
      const fetchItems = async () => {
        // Indicate that a fetch request is starting
        dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });
    
        try {
          // Fetch items from the SharePoint list using PnP.js
          const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(listName).items();
          // On success, dispatch the fetched items to be stored in state
          dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: items });
        } catch (err) {
          // On error, store an error message
          dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', payload: 'Failed to fetch list items' });
        }
      };
    
      /**
       * Use useEffect to fetch items on initial render (component mount).
       * This ensures that as soon as the component loads, data retrieval begins.
       */
      useEffect(() => {
        fetchItems();
      }, []);
    
      return (
        <div>
          {/* Show a loading indicator while items are being fetched */}
          {state.loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
    
          {/* Display any error messages in red */}
          {state.error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{state.error}</p>}
    
          {/* Render the fetched items as a list */}
          <ul>
            {state.items.map((item) => (
              <li key={item.Id}>{item.Title}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
    
          {/* If there's an error, provide a retry button */}
          {state.error && <button onClick={fetchItems}>Retry</button>}
        </div>
      );
    };
    
    export default ReactUseReducerHookBasic;
    ```
    
    **How It Works**
    
5. **Reducer & Initial State**
    
    * The component imports `listReducer` and `initialState` from your `listReducer` file. These define how your state transitions happen (e.g., `FETCH_START`, `FETCH_SUCCESS`, `FETCH_ERROR`) and what the initial data, loading, and error values should be.
        
6. **Dispatching Actions**
    
    * Before making the fetch call, the component dispatches `{ type: 'FETCH_START' }` to set `loading: true`.
        
    * On success, it dispatches `{ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: items }` to store the items and set `loading: false`.
        
    * On error, it dispatches `{ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', payload: 'Error message' }`, which sets `loading: false` and updates the `error` field.
        
7. **useEffect**
    
    * The component calls `fetchItems()` once after it mounts, kicking off the data load immediately.
        

## SPFx-Specific Best Practices and Folder Structure

When building SPFx web parts with PnP.js and React, adopting a structured folder approach helps keep your project scalable. Here’s a recommended structure:

```bash

src/
├── components/             # UI Components
│   ├── ReactUseReducerHookBasicExample.tsx   # The component for fetching and displaying items
│   ├── ....  # other default files
├── state/                  # State management logic
│   ├── actions/            # Action types and creators
│   │   ├── listActionsTypes.ts   # Action types for list fetching
│   ├── reducers/           # Reducer logic and initial states
│   │   ├── listReducer.ts        # Reducer for managing list state
│   │   ├── initialStates.ts     # Initial state for reducers
│   └── index.ts            # Re-export reducers and actions
├── services/               # API or utility services
│   ├── spService.ts        # SPFx or PnP.js services for SharePoint API
│   └── index.ts
├── hooks/                  # Custom hooks
│   ├── useFetchListItems    # Custom hook for fetching SharePoint list items
│   └── index.ts            # Re-export all hooks
├── utils/                  # General utility functions
│   ├── logger.ts           # Logging utility
│   ├── helpers.ts          # Helper functions
│   └── index.ts
```

## When to Use `useReducer` Hook in SPFx Solutions

In **SPFx** projects using **PnP.js**, deciding between `useState` and `useReducer` often comes down to the complexity of your data-fetching logic:

### `useState` Approach

* **Use** `useState` if your code is relatively **simple** and you only need a few pieces of state.
    
* **Great for simple scenarios** or small components where you have only a few states (`loading`, `error`, `data`).
    
* **Less setup complexity**, since you can directly call `setLoading(true)`, then `setItems(...)`, etc.
    
* **Becomes harder to scale** if you introduce more states or transitions (e.g., pagination, multiple fetch calls).
    

### `useReducer` Approach

* **Use** `useReducer` when you need **more structure**, have **multiple transitions**, or want a **centralized** place to manage complex state logic.
    
* **Centralizes state transitions** in a single reducer function, which improves maintainability.
    
* **State transitions are complex:** For example, managing multiple form fields or implementing workflows.
    
* **State updates depend on previous state:** Such as toggling components or navigating multi-step processes.
    
* **Shared logic:** If multiple components need to follow the same state management logic.
    
* **Scalability is a priority:** For web parts with features that will grow over time.
    
* **Scales better for complex logic** (e.g., multiple fetch scenarios, merging data from several lists, advanced error handling).
    
* **Clearer action semantics**: dispatch typed actions—such as `FETCH_START`, `FETCH_SUCCESS`, `FETCH_ERROR`—making the code more self-documenting.
    

Both methods are valid. Pick the one that **best fits** your web part’s complexity and the user experience you want to deliver.
