Are you regularly using CLI for Microsoft 365 and looking for a way to be more productive? Or is this totally new for you and you are looking for something 'special' which will make CLI for M365 stand out when compared with other command line tools? Well, you are in the right place. Did you ever write a script using a bunch of different commands and for each you passed almost always the same options? Or you maybe had some scripts which you just needed to execute in a loop providing different set of options every time? Or you just needed some 'place' to keep all of your options in single place to create a kind of a context. Well CLI for Micorosft 365 now has exactly that ü§©.

## ü§î But first of all what is CLI for Microsoft 365? Quick intro

If your already know what CLI for M365 is then I suppose you may skip this partüòÄ. CLI for Microsoft 365 is a cross platform command line tool based on Node.js that helps you manage many things around Microsoft 365 and your SPFx project (yes, that as well ü§©. rename, upgrade ... you name it). To name a few, you may manage OneDrive, Planner, Power Apps and Automate, Teams, Yammer, SharePoint (of course). The list keeps on growing and growing, [check out the CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/). But it's not only about managing Microsoft 365. The CLI helps you also manage your own SPFx environment (check out the [doctor](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spfx/spfx-doctor/)) or projects (rename, upgrade etc.). This is very unique that many similar command line tools don't have. Some commands do simple things but some actually are ready to use scenarios all done under a single command. Check out the full list of [commands](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/login/#usage)
