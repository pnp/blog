Are you regularly using CLI for Microsoft 365 and looking for a way to be more productive? Or is this totally new for you and you are looking for something 'special' which will make CLI for M365 stand out when compared with other command line tools? Well, you are in the right place. In this post I will show you some tips and tricks which may improve your experience with CLI for Microsoft 365.

## ü§î But first of all what is CLI for Microsoft 365? Quick intro

If your already know what CLI for M365 is then I suppose you may skip this partüòÄ. CLI for Microsoft 365 is a cross platform command line tool you may use to manage many things. To name a few, you may manage OneDrive, Planner, Power Apps and Automate, Teams, Yammer, SharePoint (of course). The list keeps on growing and growing, [check out the CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/). But it's not only about managing Microsoft 365. The CLI helps you also manage your own spfx environment (check out the [doctor](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spfx/spfx-doctor/)) or projects (rename, upgrade etc.). This is very unique that many similar command line tools don't have. Some commands do simple things but some actually are ready to use scenarios all done under a single command. Check out the full list of [commands](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/login/#usage)

## üß† How on earth am I supposed to remember all of those commands?

That's easy, you don't üòâ. CLI got this covered for you üëç. The tool offers command completion for cmder, zsh, bash, fish, PowerShell ... gotta catch em all üôÇ. Lets go over step by step setup for PowerShell. I suppose you already have CLI for Microsoft 365 installed. If not then lets quickly install it using the following command:

```powershell
npm i -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365
```

Now we need to generate the command.json file which will have the list of all available commands and options. In order to do that lets just run:

```powershell
m365 cli completion pwsh setup --profile $profile
```

Now lets restart the PowerShell console and lets type `m365` hit TAB ... wow ü§Ø. It's that easy.

How cool is that ?! üòé

For more information check out [Command completion docs](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/completion/).

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Use only server-relative URL

Wait what was that in the last chapter. In the `--webUrl` option you only used relative part of the url? ... yeah I did üôÇ. As any command line tool that is suppose to manage Microsoft 365 the majority of commands will focus on SharePoint Online. That means working with lot of web, subweb urls. Well CLI for Microsoft 365 got you covered here as well. When logged in to your tenant (`m365 login` command) all you need is execute a command like 

```powershell
m365 spo site list
```

After that CLI will remember SPO url for you and after that you may just use server-relative part. In order to check what is the current SPO url saved use:

```powershell
m365 spo get
```

In order to set the url explicitly use:

```powershell
m365 spo set --url https://contoso.sharepoint.com
```

How cool is that ?! üòé

For more information check out [Working with SharePoint URLs in spo commands docs](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/using-cli/#working-with-sharepoint-urls-in-spo-commands).

## üí¨ Missed that required option? No problem

Ever executed a command in CLI for Microsoft 365 and got an error that you missed some required option? Well, CLI for Microsoft 365 got you covered here as well. CLI for Microsoft 365 has config that when enabled (by default it is disabled) it will start asking (prompting) for missing required options. Whaaaat ü§Ø. Lets give it a check. In order to do that lets first run:

```powershell
m365 cli config set --key prompt --value true
```

You may check the current config using:

```powershell
m365 cli config get --key prompt
```

Now if we try to execute a command and we will forget about specifying some required option we will be asked to provide it. 

![m365 command options prompt](images/prompt.gif)

How cool is that ?! üòé

One thing that is important to mention is that CLI for Microsoft 365 will not prompt for options where at least one is required. So for example in `m365 spo list get` command we may either use `--id` or `--title` to specify which list we want and we need to specify at least one of them. Currently CLI for Microsoft 365 will not prompt for neither of them and at the time of writing this article this feature is still open and waiting to be implemented.

I hope you are now wondering what other cool setting CLI for Microsoft 365 might have üòâ. I will try to go over all of them next time but till then for more information check out [Configure CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/configuring-cli/).

## üö©--Flag and --no-Flag

I wonder if you have been using CLI for some time and you knew this one? ü§î I didn't üòâ. For sure you are already aware in CLI for Microsoft 365 we have some commands that have flag options. For example in `m365 spo site add` command we have the `--wait` flag option which applies only to 'ClassicSite' and by setting it the CLI waits for site to be provisioned before completing the command. This flag may be a game changer in many script scenarios. 

So in a command like 

```powershell
m365 spo site add --type ClassicSite --url https://tenanttocheck.sharepoint.com/sites/classictest --title classictest --owners adam@tenanttocheck.onmicrosoft.com --timeZone 4 --webTemplate STS#0 
```

We will be creating a classic site and not wait for it to be fully provisioned before we proceed with other commands. If we want to wait we may just include the `--wait` flag and thats it. Seems easy right? Well the answer is yes and no üôÇ. Yes if you are already familiar with this behavior but if this is your first time writing or reading this command this might not be so obvious. So in order to improve the readability of the command we may use `--no-wait` flag. This way we will be explicit that we don't want to wait for the site to be provisioned. 

```powershell
m365 spo site add --type ClassicSite --url https://tenanttocheck.sharepoint.com/sites/classictest --title classictest --owners adam@tenanttocheck.onmicrosoft.com --timeZone 4 --webTemplate STS#0 --no-wait
```

This may seems like something very small and not worth using but lets think of it in a way that we want to make sure that the script is easy to read and understand for a potential developer that might be modifying our script in the future and might not be familiar with this command. This is one of the many small things that can make a big difference.

## ü§∑ Is that all? 

As you probably see CLI has it's cool features one might not notice at first glance but it is for sure good to know them. This of course is only a part of them and we could go over many more like: did you know you may use CLI for Microsoft 365 not only in command line but also when building your software ü§Ø. Yes, if you are building apps in Node.js you may reference CLI for Microsoft 365 as a library and use it in your code as any other API üôÇ. Interested? I will try to write something more about this topic in another blog post üëç 

I hope this article was helpful for you and also pointed out some nice features which will make you give [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) a try üëç
