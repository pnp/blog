## Demos

-   **D1:  Visio, Power BI Tiles, and Reports in Power Apps! --** how to
    combine capabilities in Visio, Power BI tiles/Reports and in Power
    Apps to deliver inventory management and desk reservation
    solutions.  Apps are sharing information and contextually aware of
    each other = fully interactive Power Apps and Visio diagrams inside
    Power BI reports and Power BI tiles or full Power BI Reports with
    Visio diagrams and filters inside of Power Apps using an embed URL. 
      

-   **D2:  Power Apps Design Philosophy** -- an approach/process to
    building Apps.  Planning (before building) the "Canvas" -- customer
    profile, value map and fit.   Start with a customer profile - what
    customer wants to achieve, what they are doing today, their pains,
    their potential gains. Then create a value map (products and
    services, pain relievers and gain creators) and finally align or fit
    the two to excite customers about your value proposition.
