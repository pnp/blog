## Katerina Chernevskaya - Senior Software Architect, MVP

![Katerina Chernevskaya](images/katerinachernevskaya.png)

My journey began years ago when, as a kid, my mom introduced me to an article about Microsoft. That moment sparked a dream to work with Microsoft technologies. For the past 20 years, I’ve lived that dream, crafting projects that harness the power of these technologies. 

I’m a fervent advocate for simple tech solutions and low-code development. As a mom to two incredible, tech-savvy kids - the elder having already aced the PL-100 and AI-102 exams at 14 - I’m passionate about making IT fun and accessible. I aim to show young people that technology is not just about coding; it’s about creating, dreaming, and turning the impossible into reality.

## Rashmee Auckloo - Pension Protection Fund, MVP

![Rashmee Auckloo](images/reshmeeauckloo.png)

I am a SharePoint Developer at Pension Protection Fund and a Microsoft MVP in M365 Development since January 2024. I started my career journey as a .Net developer before transitioning to SharePoint and Project Server in 2011. In 2021, I began my cloud journey with SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365, discovering a vast array of extensions available.

Throughout my journey, I have found community resources to be invaluable, inspiring me to contribute back. I have actively enriched the [PnP repositories](https://github.com/pnp) since 2021, focusing on [PnP Sample Scripts](https://pnp.github.io/script-samples/), [PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/), [CLI for M365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/), and related repositories. I believe in "sharing is caring" and empowering others within the tech community.

Beyond work and community engagements, I cherish spending quality time with my two daughters, family, and friends.
