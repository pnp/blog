## Credly Names Our Recognition Program ‘Best in Class’ — Thanks to You!

### ✨ *Celebrating Your Community Success: Best-in-Class Recognition from Credly*  

When you build something truly community-powered, recognition becomes a shared achievement. And when you build it with zero budget? Well, now that’s just legendary.

Recently, our Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community Recognition Program was recognized by [Credly as a “Best in Class” example](https://credlyissuer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/38488322543899-How-a-Community-with-No-Budget-Built-a-Best-in-Class-Badge-Program) of what happens when passion, creativity, and contribution come together — with no budget and no shipping department, just a whole lot of heart.

This isn’t about a team of wizards behind a curtain. This is **about you** — the contributors, presenters, sample developers, GitHub warriors, blog writers, badge earners, and Sharing is Caring attendees who make this community *what it is*. (Yes, we see your 🔥 and 💯 reactions. Keep 'em coming.)

### 🛠️ Built by the Community, For the Community  

While many recognition programs come with swag, shipping costs, and spreadsheets galore, ours was built differently. It’s a grassroots initiative, powered by volunteers, MVPs, and community contributors — not a Microsoft-funded effort, but a true **labor of love**.

The idea was simple:  
**Let’s celebrate the people who make this community thrive.**  
No budget? No problem.  
We just digitized the gratitude.

Through Credly’s platform, we launched a fun, vibrant badging program that’s helped double participation and build a deeper sense of belonging.  

Each badge is like a high-five — but with metadata and way cooler colors.

### 📣 What Credly Had to Say  

Credly featured our story in their July newsletter and even made a [video spotlight](https://vimeo.com/1092563927) about this community-powered success.

Their words?

> “This program proves that you don’t need deep pockets to build a world-class recognition program.”  

Translation: *We did a lot with a little — and it worked because you showed up.* 🙌

You showed up to present.  
You showed up to learn.  
You showed up to help others.  
You showed up to be a part of something bigger than yourself.

And that’s the **empathy** of this community.

### 🧭 What’s Next?

We’re not done yet. This is just the beginning.

We’re continuing to improve the program, add new badges, and explore more ways to celebrate all the amazing things you’re doing. And yes, the fun badge themes (ie. May the Fourth Be with You, Super Hero Season, etc.) will remain part of the brand!

If you’re not yet part of the Community Recognition Program, [now’s the time to join](https://aka.ms/community/recognition). It’s free, it’s fun, and we *literally* give you badges for being awesome. Win-win.
