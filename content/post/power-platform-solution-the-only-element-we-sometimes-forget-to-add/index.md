# Introduction

Have you ever been in a situation that your Power Platform project should have only one element and you ended with one hundred elements or your admin told you that you have to migrate your tools to diffrent environment? If the answer is yes, you are in right place.:smiley:

Power Platform is powerfull set of tools for automating (improving) processes quit easy, but it also has a cost. Usually to create even simple solution we end up with several elements. Bigger complexity is equal to more elements.Very offen in big project when we don't follow some rules we lose the track what is going on.

Good news is that there is a way how we can solve this problems. Power Platform solution is a hero of a day. In this post I will describe what is solution, show two scenarios (with and without solution), describe how to migrate solutions beetwen environemnts and write about prons and cons of solutions.
