Usually to create even a simple application we have to implement several elements. Other words, more complex process results in more elements. Very often in big project when we don't follow some rules we lose the track what is going on. Adding migration between environments to the list of tasks can lead to significant delays and frustration.:open_mouth:

Good news is that there is a way how we can solve those problems. Power Platform <em>solution</em> can improve application management and give us reliable tools boosting productivity. In this post I will describe what is <em>solution</em>, show two scenarios (with and without solution), describe what are common mistakes and show how to fix them.

# What is <em>Solution</em>:grey_question:

In simple terms, <em>solution</em> is a container where we can add all components belong to our application. It can be Canvas app, Dataverse table, Power Automate flows, security roles and much, much more.
