This blog post will summarize how I did the brand new [Microsoft Graph
Fundamentals Learning
path](https://learn.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-msgraph-fundamentals/).
Microsoft Graph Fundamentals consists of 3 modules:

1.  What is Microsoft Graph - lets you understand the Graph services and
    shows you how you can access user information from Graph using their
    learning playground called Graph Explorer. You will do a short
    exercise on that as well.

2.  Configure a JavaScript application to retrieve Microsoft 365 data
    using Microsoft Graph - lets you understand how app registration
    works in Azure AD with permissions for Microsoft Graph powered apps
    and closes with two exercises using MSAL - making authentication
    easy.

3.  Access user photo information with Microsoft Graph - in this module,
    you continue with the application you built-in module 2 and learn
    how to retrieve a user photo and do an exercise about it.

The whole learning path is estimated to take us \~75 minutes. Let's see
how it goes 

 

To be very honest: I worked with Graph before, but
it's the first time I do this guided learning on Microsoft Learn. I
will cover module 1 in this post and continue with module 2 and 3 in the
following posts.

## What is Microsoft Graph

In super short: Microsoft Graph is a set of APIs that lets you access
data in Microsoft 365 and use it for custom coded and low code
applications. With this, Microsoft Graph is your key to data. Here are
three tremendous advantages of it:

-   across all Microsoft services, you can use one
    endpoint `https://graph.microsoft.com` -
    which makes development straightforward as you don't need to learn
    all the different APIs for mail and calendar and files and so on
-   documentation is fantastic, and there is a ton of learning
    material - like this learning path or the upcoming [Learn Together-
    Building apps with Microsoft Graph
    event](https://learntogether-graph.splashthat.com/)
-   you can try out Graph in [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) - if
    you like to read more about that, read my blog post on [how to get
    started with Graph
    Explorer](https://m365princess.com/how-to-get-started-with-graph-explorer/)
-   Microsoft Graph Toolkit (you will learn more about it later) makes
    authentication (my personal kryptonite) easy. It also provides you
    with ready-to-use components and reduces the time you need to
    develop.

### Intro

For this module, you will need to be a global admin in a Microsoft 365
tenant. The easiest way to have this is to [join the Microsoft 365
developer
program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) and
get a free E5 subscription. If you are not familiar with this,
read [Julie Turner's article about
it](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/what-is-a-dev-tenant-and-why-would-you-want-one/ba-p/2036610),
at least some basic JavaScript understanding, and you should know what
Azure Active Directory does. You will also need to
have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

The learning module introduces you to a business scenario so that it is
easier for you to imagine which kind of applications we are talking
about. In this scenario, we want to bring together messages from chat,
emails, attended meetings, notes, key contacts, and relevant files.

Our application could also grow later on and bring in data from more
services like Windows 10 services or Enterprise Mobility and Security
Services. We will not build this in total in this learning path, but we
get a perspective, what we can develop based on our organization's
needs.

### Understand Microsoft Graph Services

At the very heart of Graph, we will find users and groups. In our
application, we will need to access data from a single user's personal
scope (mail, messages, events) and a group scope (teamwork).

The module introduces you to some Microsoft Graph API calls and shows
you how the response will look. All API responses will be in JSON
format - in case you want to learn more about it, read this article by
Bob German on [Introduction to
JSON](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/introduction-to-json/ba-p/2049369)

The even more exciting part is that apart from making direct API calls,
Microsoft provides us with the Graph SDK (Software Developer Kit). We
can use the client Graph SDK client libraries to even more easily call
the Graph API.

### Access user information from Microsoft Graph using Graph Explorer

This chapter introduces you to Graph Explorer -easily access it
at [aka.ms/ge](https://aka.ms/ge), try out some sample queries! My blog
post on [how to get started with Graph
Explorer](https://m365princess.com/how-to-get-started-with-graph-explorer/) explains
that in detail.

### Exercise - Access user information from Microsoft Graph using Graph Explorer

Time to access your own data! I strongly recommend not playing in your
production tenant- especially if you do not only want to read data
with **GET** requests but also want to write, update, or delete data
with **POST, PATCH, UPDATE, or DELETE** requests. Get yourself a
Microsoft 365 developer tenant and use this.

This chapter teaches you how to modify permissions in Graph explorer and
how tips help you.

You will learn how to send a message to Teams via Graph - this is not a
test; it will really appear in Teams.

Let us 1'up this already fantastic experience. Besides using this
beautiful UI, Graph Explorer provides you with:

-   Access tokens used for authentication (recognizing who a user is)
    and authorization (looking up the correct privileges)
-   Code snippets for three different languages so that you can
    copy-paste them into your applications
-   Microsoft Graph Toolkit components - most fabulous thing ever! If
    you are not familiar with MGT, [go check it
    out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbAZHvB5NEk)
-   Adaptive cards snippets so you can quickly build UI components for
    your apps

You see, this is the 'absolutely carefree package' provided by the
Microsoft Graph team.

## Conclusion on Module 1

Microsoft Graph is not only THE door opener to access all kinds of
information and data across Microsoft 365 for developers and makers.
They also provide us with this fantastic learning playground, aka Graph
Explorer, in which we can try out, learn, explore and get snippets for
all kinds of development scenarios.

After introducing you to some basic concepts on Microsoft Graph, you
have learned on a real-world example how to use Microsoft Graph before
continuing to access data via Graph in a JavaScript application. This
learning module is fantastic! If you never heard about Graph, you'll
get everything you need to start right away with it!
