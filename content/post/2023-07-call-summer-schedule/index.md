## Frequently asked questions

**Why are you having this break in the calls?**

Lot of Microsoft employees are taking time off during these months and we were expecting to have a lower interest from the product group to present in this call. To make things as clear as possible from timing perspective, we wanted to have explicit months defined to be skipped rather than specific calls. 

**I did not see this break in the recurrent invite - why is that?**

Unfortunately, recurrent invite cannot have specific months off in the configuration, so it was impossible to define the break there. 

**Can you send cancellations for me?**

As we have not sent the invite for you, it has been rather shared for download, we do not know who have downloaded the recurrent invite to their calendar. So - we cannot unfortunately send you an update.

**When will the call be again organized?**

We will restart the weekly call on Tuesday's at 8 AM Pacific Time (PT) on 22nd of August. 

**Is all calls on a break during July and August?**

No. Only the Tuesday call is on the break. All other bi-weekly and monthly calls are happening normally. We are expecting a bit lower attendance due the seasonal impact, but you are more than welcome to join the calls.

**How to take this into account in my calendar?**

Easiest way is to simply delete the individual invites of the recurrent Tuesday call from your calendar one by one.
