As we all know, Viva connection is a part of Employee Experience
Platform.

In this article you can expect to quickly add your home site portal as
Viva connection app right into your Microsoft Teams

Before we move ahead, a quick note,

1.  If you don't have an existing home site in your tenant you can
    Create a SharePoint Home Site by navigating to SharePoint Admin
    Centre \> Active sites \> Select any site you want to convert it to
    Home Site, you will see an option in the command bar like Change
    Home Site as shown in Fig 1.1

Step 3: By default, Microsoft has blocked the Viva connections app. So,
in the manage apps, you will find a search box, search for viva
connections, you will find **Viva Connections app**, with **status as
Blocked**
Select the app, select  Allow from the top command bar, the status will
be changed to Allowed as shown in Fig 1.4
