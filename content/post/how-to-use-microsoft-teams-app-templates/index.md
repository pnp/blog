Microsoft Teams can be extended in several different ways using no-code,
low-code and custom code solutions. Microsoft Teams app templates are a
great way to start discovering ideas, extensibility options and examples
of application architectures and coding patters or just start using an
app right away in your organization. App templates are community driven,
open source and production-ready apps.

Installation instructions, detailed prerequisites and source code are
available for each app on GitHub ([Office
Developer](https://github.com/OfficeDev/)). You can install each app as
it is or clone the GitHub repository of an app and start developing it
for your own purposes. You can find a detailed list of app templates
here: [App Templates for Microsoft
Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates).
In time of writing this article there are already 45 templates
available.

App templates are developed using several different technologies and an
app can utilize one or more of there technologies.

-   Microsoft Teams Bots ([What are conversational
    bots?](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots))
-   Tabs ([What are Microsoft Teams custom
    tabs?](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs))
-   Personal apps (tabs available on Teams left-rail)
-   Message extensions ([What are messaging
    extensions?](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions))
-   Power Apps and Power Automate workflows ([Teams integration with
    Microsoft Power
    Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-power-platfom-integration))
-   SharePoint sites, lists, pages and templates

**Prerequisites**

-   Microsoft 365 tenant. If you are a developer, you can get a free
    Microsoft 365 Developer tenant by [joining a Microsoft 365 Developer
    program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program). 
-   Depending on an app template, you may also require a Microsoft Azure
    subscription for running web applications, workflows and for data
    storage. You can get a free trial subscription with \$200 credits
    for first 30 days and 12 months of popular free services
    here: [Azure trial
    subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
-   Some templates may require a Power BI license, which is now included
    in new Microsoft 365 Developer subscription tenants. You can also
    use Power BI Pro trial license on your tenant.
-   Depending on a template Power Apps and Power Automate flows can be
    tested either in default Power Platform environment created for
    Office 365 subscription or some applications may require Dataverse
    environment. For production usage I suggest creating a separate
    production environment, if your organization doesn't have one
    already.

**Deploying an app template to your environment**

Once you have picked a template, first thing is to read the
documentation. Documentation contains an overview of the solution,
solution architecture, data storage and detailed deployment
instructions. For Azure related resources there is also a cost
estimation. All apps can be deployment following deployment guide.
Depending on a template you may require to deploy and configure

-   App Registration to Azure Active Directory
-   Resources to Azure using ready-made ARM template
-   Import and configure a Power App and/or Power Automate Flow
-   Create artifacts like sites and lists to SharePoint manually, with
    Power Automate or with PowerShell
-   Install the app to Teams using side-loading or uploading to app
    catalog

**Deploying an Azure resources**

For Azure based resources you need to have an Azure subscription and
permissions to deploy resources to the subscription. For Azure AD App
registration you need to have Global Admin role access to Azure Active
Directory in your Microsoft 365 tenant.

All Azure related services are created with Azure Resource Manager
template (ARM). Each app has a Deploy to Azure button, which opens up
the Azure Portal based on your credentials.

![Deploy to Azure button](images/68747470733a2f2f617a7572656465706c6f792e6e65742f6465706c6f79627574746f6e2e706e67.png)

Easiest way is to use that browser session, where you have logged in
with an account linked to your Azure subscription where you like to
deploy the services. Based on required resources for the app, ARM
template is providing different configuration options.

![Deploy resources to Azure](images/teams-app-azure-deployment.png)

First pick-up a subscription and a resource group to deploy new
resources. I suggest creating a new resource group for the app, at least
when you are testing, so you can easily manage app's resources and
access to them. Choose something unique for Base Resource Name, it's
quite commonly used as part of deployed service URL endpoints, so it
needs to be globally unique. Refer the app deployment documentation for
other configuration options. Once complete select Create and Azure
resource deployment begins. Depending on a type and number of services,
it can take up to 15 minutes to complete. Azure portal will notify when
resources are deployed.

**Considerations**

Each app template with Azure resources also contains a documentation
about estimated costs. Cost estimation is based on production usage for
certain number of users and usage of the app. Actual costs depend on how
resources are scaled and how much usage there is. 

For testing apps you can scale down at least the app service plan and
Azure Search. Note that Azure Search cannot be scaled after deployment. 

**Deploying SharePoint resources**

Some app templates require you to create new resources, like sites and
lists, to SharePoint Online. SharePoint resources are created with a
PowerShell script provided in deployment guide, with a Power Automate
Flow or manually. If the app is using a premade site template,
deployment is done from SharePoint Lookbook. For scripts you need [PnP
PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets) module
installed and easiest way is to install it from PowerShell Gallery by
running a command
 
```powershell
Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline
```
 
When SharePoint resources are deployed with Power Automate, first you
import a Flow to your environment in [Power Automate
portal](https://flow.microsoft.com/), configure the Flow and run it
manually. Creating resources manually is guided in the deployment guide,
remember to use exact column names or otherwise rest of the solution
might not work correctly.

**Deploying a Power App**

Power Apps are first deployed to Power Apps environment in Power Apps
maker portal. Depending of a template app is either uploaded as a Canvas
App (image below) on Apps page or as a solution in Solutions page.
Solution require a separate Dataverse environment, which can be created
from Power App admin portal.

![Import a Power App](images/Screenshot 2021-01-13 175255.png)

After import is complete, you can create a Teams app package for created
Power App by selecting "*Add to Teams*". Fill-out details and click
Download app.

![Download Teams app package for a Power App](images/2021-01-13_17-54-25.png)

Install the app (downloaded zip file) to Teams either using side-loading
or uploading the app to Teams app catalog.

**Installing an app to Teams**

When you have your Teams app package ready, either downloaded from Power
Apps portal or created following deployment guide, you can install it to
Teams. Depending on your tenant's configuration, there is two options
for installing an app. With sideloading you can upload the app to you or
your team. App is not available for anyone else in your tenant. To
sideload an app open "Apps" in bottom left corner on Teams client,
select "*Upload a custom app*" and select "*Upload for me or my
teams*". If the option is not available for you, sideloading is
disabled. Configure the app and you're done.

![Add an app to Teams](images/2021-01-13_18-13-21.png)


For uploading an app to your whole tenant, select \"*Upload a custom
app*\" and select \"*Upload for \<your tenant name>*\". App will appear
on \"*Built for \<your tenant name>\"* section on Apps. Other option is
to upload your app on Teams Admin Center's app catalog. After uploading
an app, it will be available for your users.

**Wrap-up**

Teams app templates are ready to use solutions. Deployment and
installation to Teams is fairly simple, when you have needed services
and tools in place, just by following a deployment guidance. Templates
are also great way to learn how solutions around Microsoft Teams can be
built using different technology approaches and patterns. Always see the
documentation first to see what is the purpose of the app, how it is
built, what data is stored and what are the possible costs.
New app templates are introduces quite often, so also remember to check
out what new apps are available.
