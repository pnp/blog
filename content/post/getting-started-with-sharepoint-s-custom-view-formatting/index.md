## Introduction

In a previous [blog
post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/getting-started-with-sharepoint-s-custom-column-formatting/ba-p/2207937),
the basic building blocks of custom *column* formatting were introduced
to us. From that, we learned how to customize our columns to create some
interesting visuals.

Things look better, but each column is still a separate component. What
if we want to tie them all together into a more cohesive presentation?
The good news is that we can! Just like we customized our columns, we
can also customize SharePoint list views! That will allow us to go from
a traditional table/column/cell view, to something that looks 'put
together', like so\...

## Preparing for your journey

Before you get going, there are a few things that will help prepare you
for the trek ahead.
If you haven't, I would highly recommend reading the first blog post in
this series: [Getting started with SharePoint's custom column
formatting](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/getting-started-with-sharepoint-s-custom-column-formatting/ba-p/2207937).
You can also refer to the [official
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/view-formatting)
for view formatting to help fill in any gaps not covered here.
I should also warn you that your HTML and CSS skills are going to come
into play a lot more here, as you'll be trying to work with multiple
elements to position them correctly.
If you're not an expert, that's perfectly okay - I'm not one either -
you'll just need an extra dose of patience. Trial and error will get
you there, eventually. I'm not going to dwell on the particular CSS
used in these examples except in cases where it's a pattern that could
be applied to other use cases.
And that's pretty much it. There's some new stuff we'll learn about
that only applies to View formatting, but everything we learned from the
previous blog post will apply here as well.


## Choose your own adventure

In case you weren't aware, views in a Modern SharePoint list come in a
few flavors.

![list-view-flavors.png](images/list-view-flavors.png)

Most of us are probably already very familiar with the *List* layout;
It's what we've been used to for decades. *Compact List* is the same
as *List*\...just smaller. The *Tiles* view, frequently referred to as
the *Gallery* view, is somewhat newer. As you may expect, it will
display your list items as cards/tiles in a classic grid view. There's
also a *Calendar* view/layout that was recently added, but is not
currently customizable.
When it comes to custom formatting, we can customize both the *List* and
*Gallery* layouts. They do need to be customized separately, as their
schemas are *slightly* different, but they're close enough that you can
usually take your JSON from one and apply it to the other with minimal
changes.
For our journey here, we're going to start with a *List* view and then
use it to create a *Tile* view.


## I wisely started with a map

Before we get into defining our custom view formatting, it may be
helpful to spend some time up front thinking about how we'll structure
our view. The more you want to transform your view, the more important
it will be to plan things out in advance. This is where some
understanding of HTML will come in handy.
To help guide myself, I created the following image to try and visualize
how my various DIVs and other elements would be laid out.
![blowout-witharrows.png](images/blowout-witharrows.png)
This isn't necessary, obviously, but I personally find it helpful to
have a blueprint in front of me (even if it's only a mental one).


## Formatting List views

If you recall from the *[column
formatting](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/getting-started-with-sharepoint-s-custom-column-formatting/ba-p/2207937)*
article, each custom format followed the same basic structure: A
\$schema definition along with a parent HTML element and optional
attributes, styles and children.

``` JSON
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/v2/column-formatting.schema.json",
    "elmType": "div",
    "attributes": {
        "iconName": "Game"
    },
    "style": {
        "font-size": "48px",
        "color": "red"
    },
    "children: []
}
```

List views aren't that much different.

``` JSON
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/v2/row-formatting.schema.json",
    "hideSelection": true,
    "hideColumnHeader": true,
    "rowFormatter": {}
}
```

We still have our `$schema` property, but it's important to notice that
it's pointing to a different schema definition. We also have some new
optional properties: `hideSelection` & `hideColumnHeader`. As you may
suspect, `hideSelection` will do away with the ability to select a
particular list item while `hideColumnHeader` will do away with the the
column headers normally present on a list.
What's a little different here is that we're missing our parent
element. Instead, we have this `rowFormatter` property. The reason for
this is that we can choose between using this and an
`additionalRowClass` property. If you choose the latter, you're limited
to applying CSS classes to the entire row, similar to what you can do
with the out-of-box \"Conditional formatting\". If all you want to do is
make your row a different color, you're probably better off using the
*design mode* tools, but if you're interested in learning more about
the `additionalRowClass` property, it is covered well enough in the
[official
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/view-formatting#apply-conditional-classes-on-rows).
We, however, will not be satisfied with applying some simplistic
styling. NO! We are bound for greater `rowFormatter` glory!

> **NOTE**: There are other properties available that are not covered in
> this blog, most notably the `groupProps` property. This allows you to
> customize the grouping header that appears when items are grouped
> together by some column. There are also `footerFormatter` and
> `hideFooter` properties that affect the \"List Footer\" that appears
> if you're displaying item totals.
>


## One container to rule them all

The `rowFormatter` property is simply an object that wraps all of the
HTML elements we're going to create our view. If, for some reason, we
wanted every row in our list to just simply display the basic column
formatting shown in the previous section, we'd end up with the
following JSON definition.

``` JSON
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/v2/row-formatting.schema.json",
    "hideSelection": true,
    "hideColumnHeader": true,
    "rowFormatter": {
        "elmType": "div",
        "attributes": {
            "iconName": "Game"
        },
        "style": {
            "font-size": "48px",
            "color": "red"
        },
        "children: []
    }
}
```

That's probably not the greatest idea, but it does illustrate the
point. Once we make it inside of the `rowFormatter` object, it's
*almost* business as usual. There's one more difference we need to
understand\...how we reference columns.



## How to reference fields

When we were dealing with formatting individual columns, we always used
the built-in variable `@currentField`, but what about when we're
dealing with more than one view? `@currentField` is still there, but it
holds a slightly different meaning in this context. It will always be a
reference to the standard *Title* field.
![LOTR-Meme.png](images/LOTR-Meme.png)

Instead of using `@currentField` to reference a column, we'll need to
use a slightly different format: `[$InternalColumnName]`.
In our list, we have a handful of columns including a *Member* lookup
column. If we want to reference that field, we'd use `[$Member]`. Even
if we change the display name from \"Member\" to \"Hero\", our variable
would still be `[$Member]`. And, since *Member* is a lookup column, if
we want to show the display name of the user, we need to use the *title*
property. We'd do that in the following way `[$Member.title]`.



## The World Is Not In Your Books And Maps. It Is Out There

Alright. Enough with the lessons, it's time to get started.
We can use the \"map\" we created earlier and turn it into a rough
skeleton. Each layer in that blowout represent a parent/child
relationship. So, by looking at our map\...
![blowout-witharrows.png](images/blowout-witharrows.png)

We come up with this.

``` JSON
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/v2/row-formatting.schema.json",
    "hideColumnHeader": true,
    "hideSelection": true,
    "rowFormatter": {
        "elmType": "div",
        "attributes": { "title": "Parent Container" },
        "children": [{
            "elmType": "img",
            "attributes": { "title": "Background Image" },
            "children": [{
                "elmType": "div",
                "attributes": { "title": "Column Container" },
                "children": [
                    {
                        "elmType": "div",
                        "attributes": { "title": "Member/Role DIV" },
                        "children": [
                            {
                                "elmType": "img",
                                "attributes": { "title": "Large Member profile picture" }
                            },
                            {
                                "columnFormatterReference": "[$Title]"
                            }
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "elmType": "div",
                        "attributes": { "title": "Text DIV" },
                        "children": [{
                                "elmType": "div",
                                "attributes": { "title": "Member Name row/div" }
                            },
                            {
                                "elmType": "div",
                                "attributes": { "title": "Age row/div" }
                            },
                            {
                                "elmType": "div",
                                "attributes": { "title": "From row/div" }
                            }

                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "elmType": "div",
                        "attributes": {
                            "title": "Race/Weapons DIV/Column"
                        },
                        "children": [{
                                "elmType": "div",
                                "attributes": { "title": "Race icon DIV/Row" },
                                "children": []
                            },
                            {
                                "elmType": "div",
                                "attributes": { "title": "Weapon icons DIV/Row" },
                                "children": []
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }]
        }]
    }
}
```

That's the basic layout of our custom view, simply a series of parent
and child divs. We'll start filling this skeleton out with content
shortly, but there are a couple of things to point out already.
First, there are several examples of this
`"attributes": { "title": "<TEXT>" }` pattern. We can use this as a
means of commenting about the purpose of the element, since comments
aren't allowed in valid JSON and would break our view. Again, this
isn't required and adds absolutely no value to the view itself. It
does, however, help keep us (and any future adventurer) oriented as to
where we are in our JSON.

> **NOTE**: Using the title attribute will cause whatever you specify to
> be displayed as a tooltip when a user hovers over the element. You can
> remove your titles after you done, if that bothers you. Otherwise,
> just be aware that users may see your witty comments.


Also, in the "Member/Role DIV" children, the second child looks a
little peculiar.

    {
        "columnFormatterReference": "[$Title]"
    }

This `columnFormatterReference` property is a nifty shortcut that tells
the view formatter to display the referenced field (*Title*, in this
case) as it normally would, including any custom column formatting that
may have been configured. This is a great opportunity for some
reusability, especially if you want the column to show exactly the same
way on every view.
If you take our skeleton and put it into SharePoint, there's not going
to be much to look at. So let's fix that.



## Putting some meat on the bone

Now that we've got our skeleton all rigged up, it's time to fill it
out some.
It's certainly a little short and skinny, so let's start by defining
some CSS on our parent div. We know we want a border around the whole
thing, as well as a particular font style and size, so we can apply
those things at the top level.

``` JSON
"style": {
    "position": "relative",
    "border": "5px solid black",
    "border-radius": "10px",
    "width": "600px",
    "height": "175px",
    "font-family": "Luminari, Papyrus, Brush Script MT",
    "font-size": "24px"
}
```

We're also specifying a `position` value of \"relative\", which tells
the browser to display that DIV relative to it's parent container. In
this case, that parent container will be the row in the list. It won't
have any noticeable effect here, but will help us later.
Let's also go ahead and setup our second layer too, our background
image. Normally, we'd just use the css property `background-image` and
point it to a URL. Unfortunately, we can't do that here because the `(`
character is prohibited in most use cases. So, instead, we have to use
an **img** element and size it appropriately.

``` JSON
{
    "elmType": "img",
    "style": {
        "width": "100%",
        "height": "100%",
        "z-index": "-3",
        "opacity": ".5"
    },
    "attributes": {
        "title": "Background Image",
        "src": "=@currentWeb + '/SiteAssets/MiddleEarthLocales/' + [$From.lookupValue] + '.jpg'"
    },
    "children": [...]
}
```

We've added the `src` attribute, which should look mostly familiar.
Notice, though, that we're referencing the **\[\$From\]** variable.
We're also setting the width and height to be 100% of the parent so the
image fills the space and we're setting the opacity to half so that the
image is a little on the transparent side (this will help the text and
images we lay on top of it stand out more).
Finally, we're setting this `z-index` property to a negative value.
Typically, HTML will render any content inside of the div on top of the
div. Think of it like a stack of plates. That last thing you put on the
stack is the most visible. We can use the `z-index` property to affect
that, and by setting to a negative value here, we're ensuring that out
content will be rendered behind our parent div. Without this, the
background image would cover up our border.


## Stylin' and Profilin'

Now that we've got our first two layers done, let's take a look at our
third layer. If we refer back to our skeleton, we can see that our
**img** element has a single child titled "Column Container", and that
child has three children of its own. What we want to happen is to have a
three-column layout and to do that, we're going to style this \"column
container\" like so.

``` JSON
"style": {
    "position": "absolute",
    "width": "100%",
    "height": "100%",
    "display": "flex"
}
```

We have to specify the width and height here as being **"100%"**
because, without it, the DIV will only grow as large as the content and
we want to ensure that it stays as large as it can. We're also
specifying a different `position` value here - **absolute** - which
basically tells the browser to render our DIV at a specific position. In
this case, we're letting it default the starting point, which is the
\"top left corner\" of the first ancestor element with a \"position\"
attribute on it (in this case, our parent div, which we said was
**relative** positioned).
We're also specifying a `display` property with a value of **flex**.
This creates what's known as \"Flexbox\" which will help us deal with
the concept of turning our child DIVs into \"Columns\" and \"Rows\".
Now that we've got our container, let's work on the next three
children, which will represent our three columns.


## First column

We'll just div right into the definition for our first column, which is
a simple parent div to hold our image and role icon.

``` JSON
{
    "elmType": "div",
    "attributes": { "title": "Member/Role DIV" },
    "children": [
        {
            "elmType": "img",
            "attributes": {
                "src": "=replace([$Member.picture], 'MThumb', 'LThumb')"
            },
            "style": {
                "height": "175px",
                "width": "175px",
                "border-style": "solid",
                "border-color": "black",
                "border-width": "0px 5px 0px 0px"
            }
        },
        {
            "columnFormatterReference": "[$Title]"
        }
    ]
}
```

Two points of interest here.
First, for the `src` attribute for our **img** property, we're using
the `replace()` function to swap out the text 'MTHUMB' for 'LTHUMB'.
When a user uploads a profile picture, SharePoint will create three
versions of it (large, medium, and small). For formatting, referencing
the `picture` property will always return the medium thumbnail. Rather
than stretching a smaller thumbnail, we can use pattern to retrieve the
larger one instead.
Also, because we formatted the *Role* (which is a rename of the *Title*
column), we don't have specify the definition here. Instead, we're
using the `columnFormatterReference` property and referencing our field.
> **NOTE**: The column formatting for Role was slightly updated from the
> previous blog.

Just for reference, here's the definition we created for the custom
column formatting used on the *Role* field.

``` JSON
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/v2/column-formatting.schema.json",
    "elmType": "div",
    "style": {
        "width": "24px",
        "height": "24px",
        "font-size": "24px",
        "background-color": "green",
        "color": "white",
        "position": "absolute",
        "left": "0",
        "bottom": "0",
        "border-radius": "4px"
    },
    "children": [{
        "elmType": "div",
        "style": {
            "margin": "auto"
        },
        "attributes": {
            "iconName": "=if(@currentField == 'Ring-bearer', 'StatusCircleRing', if(@currentField == 'Guardian', 'Shield', if(@currentField == 'Melee', 'DecisionSolid', 'Bullseye')))"
        }
    }]
}
```

At this point, we have something like the below image.
![column-1.png](images/column-1.png)


## Second column

Our second column consists of three rows, each containing a different
bit of text relating information about the current member. Here's the
definition for this section.

``` JSON
{
    "elmType": "div",
    "attributes": {
        "title": "Text DIV"
    },
    "style": {
        "padding-left": "5px",
        "color": "white",
        "width": "inherit",
        "text-shadow": "2px 2px 0 #000000",
        "font-weight": "bolder",
        "display": "flex",
        "flex-direction": "column",
        "justify-content": "space-between"
    },
    "children": [
        {
            "elmType": "div",
            "style": {
                "font-size": "1.5em"
            },
            "txtContent": "[$Member.title]"
        },
        {
            "elmType": "div",
            "style": {
                "font-size": "1.25em"
            },
            "txtContent": "='Age: ' + [$Age.displayValue]"
        },
        {
            "elmType": "div",
            "style": {
                "font-size": "1.25em"
            },
            "txtContent": "='From: ' + [$From.lookupValue]"
        }
    ]
}
```

The only thing of real note here is that our parent container in this
case is again defining a \"Flexbox\" with its `display` property. We're
also using two new properties, `flex-direction` and `justify-content`,
to control how our children are displayed relative to one another.

We're using the `width` property with a value of **inherit** to force
our column to take up the maximum amount of width possible. It won't
have a noticeable affect here, but will come into play in the next
section.
The `flex-direction` property tells the browser to make each child grow
to take up the entire column, width wise. That will force each child div
onto its own line.
The `justify-content` property, on the other hand, tells the browser to
evenly distribute our rows across the available height.

We're getting closer to our desired end result.
![column-2.png](images/column-2.png)



## The final column

Our last column consists of two rows of equal size to hold our Race and
Weapon Icons. Let's take a look.

``` JSON
{
    "elmType": "div",
    "attributes": { "title": "Race/Weapons DIV/Column" },

There's nothing new to discuss here, but it does finish off our sample.

## Our adventure draws near its end

Now that we've got our view formatted, we're done, right? We could be,
but the list view is off somehow\...
![list-view-complete.png](images/list-view-complete.png)
Look at all that empty white space! Such a waste, but showing each item
in a row is what the list view does. Sometimes, that may be exactly what
you need in some cases but here\...we don't need it.
Instead, we can use the \"Gallery\" (or \"Tile)\" view, which will
display our items in a grid view.
We can copy the the schema we've already defined, and change the
selected layout from \"List\" to \"Gallery\"
![format-options.png](images/format-options.png)
After that, we can paste it in, but we'll need to modify things every
so slightly, as the Gallery layout has some additional properties we
need to specify. Let's look at the basic schema for a gallery view.

``` JSON
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/v2/tile-formatting.schema.json",
    "height": 175,
    "width": 650,
    "fillHorizontally": true,
    "hideSelection": true,
    "formatter": { }
}
```

Unlike columns and list view formats, the tile schema wants us to
specify an exact `width` and `height` (in pixels) for each tile. It's
not strictly required, but we'll want to supply our own values here to
ensure that each card has the right dimensions.
We're also using a new property, `fillHorizontally`, which will ensure
that our cards do not overlap one another.
Finally, instead of the `rowFormatter` object we use in List views, we
have a simple `formatter` property for our Tile views.
After that, we can simply copy the contents of the `rowFormatter`
property in the list view example and paste them into the new
`formatter` property.
Doing that should get us to where we want to be.

## Prologue

Over the course of two blogs, we've covered the basic building blocks
of custom column formatting as well as how to customize our list and
gallery views. We turned a boring old list of text into far less boring
visuals, and then turned those visuals into a \"who's who\" of Middle
Earth. 
And while our journey together might be coming to an end, it doesn't
mean your adventures are over. Take what you've learned, go out into
the world, and make your lists beautiful!
