I recently encountered a scenario recently where I was looking to do a
quick technical check on some advice I was giving to another member of
the community regarding PowerShell -- especially capturing the output of
PnP PowerShell commands and store in a text file.  When I responded to
the tweet, I was away from my computer, but I did have my iPad (with
keyboard) with me and wanted to see if I could use PnP PowerShell with
Azure Shell -- you may have guessed the result by -- YES you can.  
 
I was not using best security practice at the time to log in
(username/password), which would not work if I had MFA on the account
(which I should have ☹). I will include better practice configuration to
include certificates and an Azure AD App in this article.
 
## What you will need

So, let's get started; you will need a few things to get going,

-   **Azure Subscription** - this is necessary for a storage account
    that preserves your files between sessions and is mandatory for
    Azure cloud shell to work.
-   **Azure Resource Group** -- the grouping of resources in Azure
-   **Azure KeyVault** - to store a certificate for a secure connection
    to M365 services.
-   **PnP PowerShell** - the newest PnP power shell module, this article
    uses v1.5.0
-   Permissions to ***consent*** an app as this uses an Azure AD app for
    the authentication.
-   **Windows Machine** -- for creating the app and certificate.
-   If setting up services locally by PowerShell, then [install the Az
    module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az/5.8.0).

## Setting Up

There are a few tasks we are going to do to set up working with Azure
Shell, Azure AD App and Certificates.
 
### Activate Azure Shell

First, let's go ahead and activate the Azure Shell; we will use this to
set up the required resources as well:
Navigate to <https://shell.azure.com> or select  the icon in the Azure
Portal.

Then run through the first setup of the Azure Shell:

![Welcome screen Azure Shell](images/Azure Shell - First Welcome.png)

Select PowerShell. Then run through the first setup of the Azure Shell:

![Simple setup screen for storage](images/Azure Shell - Simple Setup.png)

If you choose `Create storage` at this point, then this will set up
the storage account and resource group for you, using Azure's naming
standards and region. If you want to specify:

-   Subscription
-   Region
-   Resource Group
-   Storage account
-   File share name

![Azure Shell Advanced Setup](images/Azure Shell Advanced Settings.png)

Then select Advanced settings. I like to name resources myself in a
standard manner. For this article, I am going to use the advanced
options and specify:

-   Region: `North Europe`
-   Resource Group Name: `azure-cloud-shell`
-   Storage Account: "pkbtenantcloudshell"
-   File Share: `pkbtenantcloudshellfiles`

> Note: the naming of some of these resources is very strict, e.g., 3 -24characters, no spaces, lowercase

- Select `Create Storage`

![Azure Shell - Setup Complete](images/Azure Shell - Setup Complete.png)
Now the Azure Shell is ready to use.

### Installing PnP-PowerShell

Next, we need to install the PnP PowerShell module in Azure Cloud shell,
enter:
 
```powershell
Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell
```
 
The great thing about Azure Cloud Shell is the installation is
persistent between sessions, so you will only have to do this once.
However, you will need to upgrade the module periodically.
 
![Azure Shell - Install PnP PowerShell](images/Installing PnP PowerShell module.png)
For information on installing PnP-PowerShell, check out the
documentation site for more details: <https://pnp.github.io/powershell/>
 
### Create a KeyVault

Next, we want somewhere secure to store a certificate -- Azure
KeyVault.

A KeyVault is a secure method of storing keys, secrets and certificates.
We intend to keep the certificate used for this setup in the vault.
Another benefit of using this method, in larger organizations, where
other teams manage apps or the security aspect of the tenant, they can
set up this vault and retain control over the certificate and app
creation.
You can, if you prefer, navigate to the Azure Portal and use the
marketplace to create a new KeyVault resource; [check out this quick
start
guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal#sign-in-to-azure).
OR set this up in Azure Cloud Shell run the following commands:
Firstly, to check that the service is available in your preferred
region, run the following:
 
```powershell
New-AzKeyVault -VaultName 'pkbtenant-keyvault' -ResourceGroupName 'azure-cloud-shell' -Location 'North Europe'
```
 
Then, provision a new KeyVault (if you have one already, then skip this
step) and give yourself access to Secrets and Certificates.
 
```powershell
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName 'pkbtenant-keyvault' -UserPrincipalName 'paul.bullock@tenant.co.uk' -PermissionsToCertificates All -PermissionsToSecrets All
```

![Azure Shell - Create KeyVault](images/New KeyVault - AzShell.png)
Please refer to the documentation if you want to be more specific around
the KeyVault -- [Azure
Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal#create-a-vault)
[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.keyvault/?view=azps-5.9.0).
We will be importing a certificate in a later section.
 
### Create Azure AD App with Register-PnPAzureApp

There are a few options when setting up the authentication to connect
with PnP PowerShell:

-   **Azure AD App** -- using your app (recommended), which will use the APPLICATION permissions, meaning the connection will use the permissions the app does.
-   **PnP Management Shell** -- the multi-tenant app PnP provides -- this uses DELEGATE permissions meaning the connection will need to log in as the user and will only have access to services THE user has access to.
If you need clarification on the difference between the types of
permissions, I highly recommend checking out an awesome community call
demo from Philippe Signoret, Program Manager of the Microsoft Identity
team: <https://youtu.be/_BfI4L7j1Po>
 
So why are use an Azure AD app? Using the Azure Shell restricts some
authentication options when connecting to services with PnP PowerShell,
such as interactive login, because it cannot display a pop-up window.
 
![Azure Shell - doesn't support interactive login](images/PnP PowerShell - cannot use Azure Shell.png)

The `-PnPManagementShell` parameter is an option; this uses the device
login method BUT will require you to navigate to another site/page to
authenticate, including going back to grab the code -- then enter your
login credentials further steps if MFA is enabled. IMHO feels a bit
cumbersome to do this each time I want to do a task in the Shell,
especially on an iPad/phone.

### Create an Azure AD App

To set up the app quickly with PnP PowerShell, you need to use a
***Windows machine*** to run the cmdlet *`Register-PnPAzureApp`* which
generates the certificate, creates the Azure AD app, sets API
permissions, will pop up to consent to the app permissions.
Note: you may have to install the PnP PowerShell locally if you do not
already have it.
 
To set up the app, run the following command using the PnP PowerShell
cmdlet:
 
```powershell
$result = Register-PnPAzureADApp -ApplicationName "PnP PowerShell Azure Shell Access" -Tenant yourtenant.co.uk -OutPath .\ -DeviceLogin -ValidYears 2 -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "yourpassword" -AsPlainText -Force)
$result #output the result – Specifically grab the AzureAppId/ClientId – you will need this later
```

![PowerShell - Registering Azure App](images/Register App - Windows.png)

During this operation, two windows will pop-up to authenticate with the
device login method and consent to the app permissions.
 
If you want to check the app in Azure AD, navigate to:
<https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps>
and find the app called `PnP PowerShell Azure Shell Access`
 
Note: This app uses the minimum API permissions (APPLICATION) as the
default; if you want to perform operations with groups or flow as an
example, you will need to add these permissions to the app.
 
![Azure App - API permissions](images/Azure App Permissions - Application.png)
For more details on generating the app, check out the [authentication
section of the
documentation](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/authentication.html).
 
## Adding Certificate to KeyVault

Now that we have the app setup, we need to upload the certificate to the
KeyVault.
Navigate to the KeyVault in the portal
 
![Azure KeyVault - Navigating to Certificates](images/Azure KeyVault - Certificates.png)

-   Select `Import`
-   Enter a name `azureshell-pnpps-connection`
-   Select the generated certificate `PnP PowerShell Azure Shell
    Access.pfx`
-   Enter the certificate password
-   Select Create
 
![Azure Key Vault - Upload Certificate](images/KeyVault-Importing Certificate.png)
This is ready to use in a later section.
 
## Reducing the time to get going on new sessions

When I start the Azure Shell, I want to minimize the number of lines, to
connect to the services securely and get going quickly.

### Parameter Splatting

Parameter splatting is a method to pass a collection of parameters for a
PowerShell command into a variable and apply this to the cmdlet you
intend to run. Example:
 
```powershell
Get-NiceMessage -Param1 "good" -Param2 "morning" -Param3 "community"
# Splatting alternative
$MyParams = @{
    Param1 = "good",
    Param2 = "morning",
    Param3 = "community"
}
Get-NiceMessage @MyParams
```
 
This will save time if you repeatedly apply the same parameters on the
cmdlets, reducing the time to write the command and your scripts cleaner
to read.  To read more about this PowerShell feature, [check out the
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_splatting?view=powershell-7.1).
 
### PowerShell Profiles

Interestingly, I did not know about this feature until the MOTD message
appeared on the Azure Shell. I wanted to understand this further so dug
deeper and I have managed to find a way to create a startup script that
will make it easier to connect to Office 365.
With profiles, we can setup a script to run when the Azure Shell is
started, so this is an awesome opportunity to add all of the connection
information when the Shell starts including retrieval, of the
certificates from the KeyVault.
 
To create a profile that is used across sessions but for your user
account use:
 
```powershell
# Create Profile
mkdir (Split-Path $profile.CurrentUserAllHosts)
New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts -Force
```

![Azure Shell - Setup Profiles](images/Azure Shell - Setup Profile.png)
Once created, you can open an editor in the path above to the new
profile script location.

Then using the following example, using a combination of parameter
splatting and profiles, you can setup everything you need to connect to
the service:
 
```powershell
# Connect to KeyVault Data
try{
    $vaultName = "pkbtenant-keyvault" # Replace with your KeyVault name
    $appName = "PnP PowerShell Azure Shell Access"
    $appId = (Get-AzADApplication -DisplayName $appName).ApplicationId
    $tenantId = (Get-AzContext).Tenant.Id
    $certName = "azureshell-pnpps-connection"
    $baseSite = "https://tenant.sharepoint.com" # Replace with your tenant
    $base64Cert = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $vaultName -Name $certName -AsPlainText
    # Use of parameter splatting
    $ConnectInfo = @{
        ClientId = $appId
        CertificateBase64Encoded = $base64Cert
        Tenant = $tenantId
    }
    Write-Host "Ready to connect to M365/SharePoint" -ForegroundColor Green
}catch{
    Write-Host "Failed to get the KeyVault data" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```
 
Editor -- Ctrl-S (Save) then Ctrl-Q (Quit)
Restart Shell
After setting up the profile, reboot your Shell and you should see a
prompt to indicate the prerequisites are ready to use for a connection
(green text).
 
To learn more about profiles check out the [documentation for
profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-7).
 
### Connecting to the service

Once you have all these elements setup, you can connect with PnP
PowerShell with one short line:
 
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline @ConnectInfo https://tenant.sharepoint.com
# -OR-
Connect-PnPOnline @ConnectInfo $baseSite
```
 
![Azure Shell - connecting with PnP PowerShell](images/Azure Shell - Connect.png)

The settings are persistent across sessions/devices (like an Azure app
on iPad), so once setup, you can open Azure Shell and reconnect to the
service and make the changes in the Shell quickly.
 
Btw, at the beginning I mentioned about capturing the output to the text
file, this is particularly useful if you are grabbing a lot of info in
your session or need to show the changes you made, here is how to do it:
 
```powershell
Start-Transcript "log.txt"
Get-PnPWeb
Stop-Transcript
```
 
This will save the file to the current location in the Azure Shell. Use
Export-File to download it, or the UI button.


**Enjoy!**
