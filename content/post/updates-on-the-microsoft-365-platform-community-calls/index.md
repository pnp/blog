We have been hosting different set of Microsoft 365 community calls
since 2015 where we share the latest news and do live demos on the
different capabilities in Microsoft 365.
We are excited to share more details on our updated community call
structure focusing holistically on the Microsoft 365 developer platform.
Based on a community survey from spring 2021, it was visible that a more
holistic platform level messaging would be needed, rather than having
isolated community calls based on individual products in Microsoft
365. When we are creating solutions and services for the Microsoft 365,
we often combine numerous technologies across this platform stack, so
this new model is targeted on covering more widely the awesomeness of
Microsoft 365.
We will also have some Northern Hemisphere summer cancellations.
