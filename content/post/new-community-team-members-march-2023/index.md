## Jasey Waegebaert - Microsoft 365 Consultant, MVP

![Jasey Waegebaert](images/jasey.png)

As a Microsoft 365 consultant hailing from Belgium, I have two burning passions - technology and sports. But it's my love for the former that has truly taken flight since I began my journey in the Microsoft 365 universe. The endless possibilities within this domain have me hooked, and I owe a debt of gratitude to the welcoming and supportive community that has enabled my growth through shared knowledge and resources.

Now, I aim to pay it forward and give others the same support that has helped me flourish. Sharing my hard-won experience and knowledge is an enjoyable part of my work, and one that I approach with eagerness and enthusiasm.

When I'm not engrossed in the world of Microsoft 365, I'm an avid badminton player. You'll find me on the court, either honing my own skills or helping younger players master the game!

Markus is an architect and technical expert for Microsoft 365 Development at [Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/) in Germany. He is a Microsoft MVP for Microsoft 365 Development.

You probably might already know him from his various [Teams Dev samples](https://pnp.github.io/teams-dev-samples/) or [SPFx webpart samples](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-webparts/) which he regularly also demoed in the [community community calls](https://pnp.github.io/#community) and deeply explained upfront in his own personal blog. Beside that he had several more contributions to other [community initiatives](https://pnp.github.io/#home) and also acts as a public speaker from time to time.

He has come from a very long journey of nearly 25 years now in collaboration development. Starting with Lotus Notes even before Y2K, he moved over to SharePoint but now has fallen in love with the even more integrating, standardized and enterprise-ready capabilities around true Microsoft 365 Development.

## Martin Lingstuyl - Microsoft 365 Architect, MVP

![Martin Lingstuyl](images/martin.png)

Although I haven‚Äôt always worked in IT, I have always been interested in technology and coding. Around 2014 I moved to the Microsoft 365 space and have been very inspired by the things I get to do since. I‚Äôm a Microsoft 365 MVP in the M365 Development category and work as a Microsoft 365 architect at I4-YOU Business Solutions b.v., where I like to take on a broad scope on subjects relating to Microsoft 365 and Azure. You could find me talking to customers and designing solutions, writing PnP scripts, working with Azure Resources, doing some public speaking, creating Power Platform solutions, SharePoint Framework Solutions or doing regular frontend/backend work with typescript or .NET. It all has my interest.

At home you might find me giving the necessary attention to my two lovely kids and my wife. If any time is left over I‚Äôll probably be reading a good book, doing some biking, supping or surfing or some such. I also like to share my learnings using blogs and contribute back to the community in all kinds of ways. Because sharing is caring!

## Milan Holemans - Microsoft 365 Consultant, MVP

![Milan Holemans](images/milan.png)

I have always been interested in everything related to IT and technology. Yet I discovered relatively late that I like to code. Right now, I‚Äôm a Microsoft 365 consultant. I spend most of my time developing software for the Microsoft 365 cloud tailored to the customer. This ranges from front-end software, such as SharePoint Framework solutions, to back-end services that run in Azure.

In my spare time, you can find me at the gym a few days a week. With an office job you need some extra exercise. Besides that, I‚Äôm also a soccer/football fan. I try to attend every home match live in the stadium. The remaining time, I spend playing games and most importantly: contributing to the PnP community.
