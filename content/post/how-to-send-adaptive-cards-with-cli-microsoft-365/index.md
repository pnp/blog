In this blog post I want to explain how you can send an Adaptive Card
with CLI Microsoft 365. I will guide you from zero to hero :rocket:, so
even if you don't know anything about the CLI Microsoft 365 or about
Adaptive cards, don't stop reading, you will be able to do that in a
few minutes- I promise!

## What is CLI Microsoft 365?

Lets first get us all on the same page and clarify, what CLI Microsoft
365 is and why we should use it: It is a CLI (Command Line Interface)
which let's us manage Microsoft 365 from any kind of OS: It doesn't
matter if we work on Windows, MacOS or Linux. Previously, some
configurations were only possible by PowerShell for Windows, which
limited a lot of admins. But even if you work on Windows and are pretty
fine with using PowerShell, CLI might be a nice alternative to try out.

### How to use CLI Microsoft 365

I will now describe your first steps:

#### Install Node.js

To use the CLI Microsoft 365, you will need to install Node.js - Please
follow these steps:

\* go to <https://nodejs.org/en/>\
\* download the LTS version of Node.js\
\* install Node.js
If in doubt, if you have the correct version installed or if you need to
use different versions of Node.js, please read [Use Node Version Manager
to develop your SPFx
apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/use-node-version-manager-to-develop-your-spfx-apps/ba-p/2128393) by
[Toni Pohl](https://twitter.com/atwork) 

#### Install CLI Microsoft 365

Now that you have Node.js installed, we can continue with installing the
CLI Microsoft 365. You can choose any shell you like: If you want to,
you can use PowerShell or PowerShell in the Terminal in Visual Studio
Code or whatever makes you happy. I like to use the PowerShell terminal
in Visual Studio Code, because links render to be clickable and this
saves me copy/pasting links into a new browser tab. But if you like to
any other shell, that is perfectly fine as well. To install CLI
Microsoft 365, run the command:
 
```bash
npm i -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365
```
 
In case you wonder:

* the `i` is an alias for `install`
* the `-g` means that we want to install this package globally
* it will take about 2 minutes

#### Login

Now that we installed CLI Microsoft 365, it's time to actually do
something here. But before we can get or post anything, we will need to
log into our tenant. Pro Tip: You can use your your Developer tenant for
this. If you don't know, what this is, please go read [What is a "Dev
Tenant" and why would you want
one](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/what-is-a-dev-tenant-and-why-would-you-want-one/ba-p/2036610)?
by [Julie Turner](https://twitter.com/jfj1997)
Run the following command:
 

```bash
m365 login
```
 

In response you will be asked to open a web browser and login with a
code. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can select  the link,
please copy the code upfront.

After you pasted the code,

* select **Next**
* pick an account out of the list of accounts

You will be seeing this message and can close this browser tab- we
won't need it anymore.

Yay! You successfully logged in! You don't believe that? Let's check
with CLI Microsoft 365 and run this command to get your status:
 

```bash
m365 status
```
 

and it will get your status for you:

![status.png](images/status.png)

If you want some inspiration, what you could do now, run this command:
 

```bash
m365 help
```
 
![help.png](images/help.png)

which gives you a list of things you can try, these are called command
groups, as each of them can contain several commands. When you now
choose one of the command groups and run for example this one:
 

```bash
m365 outlook
```
 

you will get the commands, that are available to you in this command
group. Sometimes, you can go several levels deep-Just try them out!

## What are Adaptive Cards?

Next thing we need to know is, what are Adaptive Cards and why would we
want to use them? When we look at
[adaptivecards.io ](https://adaptivecards.io)we can read the definition
*Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI, authored in JSON,
that apps and services can openly exchange. When delivered to a specific
app, the JSON is transformed into native UI that automatically adapts to
its surroundings. It helps design and integrate light-weight UI for all
major platforms and frameworks*. This means, that we get a nice method
to share and display information without needing to know how to use
HTML/CSS to render them correctly in different host applications. If you
like to know more, please read [Get started with Adaptive
Cards](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/get-started-with-adaptive-cards/ba-p/2048786) by

## How do we send an Adaptive Card with CLI Microsoft 365?

Now that we know what is an Adaptive Card, let's have a look on how we
get this sent by CLI. The
[documentation](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/adaptivecard/adaptivecard-send/) provides
us with a sample and this sample needs to have a URL. Where do we get
this from? This depends on where you want to send this Adaptive Card to.
In this example, I want to use Microsoft Teams as host application and
therefore we will need to create an incoming webhook in Teams.

### Create the Webhook

If you have no clue what is a webhook, no problem, [Rabia
Williams](https://www.twitter.com/williamsrabia) got you covered with
[How to configure and use Incoming Webhooks in Microsoft
Teams](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/how-to-configure-and-use-incoming-webhooks-in-microsoft-teams/ba-p/2051118)
\* Open Microsoft Teams\
\* Select the ellipsis icon on the Teams channel that you want to send
the Adaptive Card to\
\* Select **Connectors**\
\* Search for 'webhook'\
![incoming-webhook.png](images/incoming-webhook.png)

\* Select **Add**\
\* Select **Add** (yes, yet again)\
\* Give your webhook a name\
\* If you like to, you can upload a picture- messages sent via this
webhook (our Adaptive Card) will have this image then as Profile Pic -
this step is optional.
\* Select **Create**\
\* Copy the generated URL\
\* Select **Done**
This URL is the URL we will need in the command later - If you want to,
paste it into a notepad or similar.

### Author your Card

Now it's time to author your card. You can do this in a lot of editors,
I use either the [Adaptive Cards
Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer),
but recently also found [Adaptive Card
Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=madewithcardsio.adaptivecardsstudiobeta).
You can also use one of the [provided
samples](https://adaptivecards.io/samples/) and use them as-is or adjust
them to your needs.

If you feel like authoring your Card in Designer or Visual Studio Code
is fine for you right now, go ahead with this, otherwise you can also
use the examples that are provided in the [documentation of CLI
Microsoft
365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/adaptivecard/adaptivecard-send/).
I used the last one, 'Send custom card with card data'.

For everyone not very familiar writing and understanding code: We can
make more sense of the snippet by copy/paste this into Visual Studio
Code, and then press Alt+z to soft-wrap this and then separate the
Adaptive Card from the rest:

* Select JSON in Language Mode\
* Insert somenew lines right before the first \`{\`\
* Delete the `'\` at the beginning and the end of the snippet\
* Format with Shift + Alt + f
Now go ahead and adjust the sample to work in your environment:
* replace the URL in the code with the URL that we copied when we added
the webhook connector to Teams\
* copy the whole code\
* run it

!! Turned out, that there are some differences how to use quotes \`'\`
or \`\"\` - please consider which shell you are using before you
copy/paste the code from [CLI Microsoft 365
documentation](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/adaptivecard/adaptivecard-send/).
Congratulations :rocket:- you sent your first adaptive Card with CLI.
