Microsoft Teams is a rich collaboration platform used by millions of
people every day. By building custom apps for Teams you can help them
work more effectively and connect them with even more knowledge and
insights. Here are some resources to help you get started.

## What kind of apps can you build on Teams 

The Microsoft Teams platform offers you several extensibility points for
building apps. On Teams you can build:

-   **tabs** that allow you to expose your whole web app inside Teams to
    let users conveniently access it without leaving Teams
-   **bots** that help people complete tasks through conversations. Bots
    are a great way to expose relevant features of your app and guide
    users through the scenario like a personal assistant
-   **messaging extensions** to help people complete tasks in a
    visually-compelling way. Messaging extensions are similar to bots
    but are more visually oriented and ideal for showing rich data
-   **webhooks** to bring notifications from external systems into
    conversations

If you have an existing web or mobile app, you can also bring
information from Teams into your app.

## Resources for getting started with building apps for Teams 

Sounds interesting? Here are some resources to help you get started
building apps for Teams.

### [Develop apps for Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-msteams-associate/?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka) (learning path) 

If you learn in a structured way and like to understand the concepts
before getting to code, this is the best place to start. This learning
path will teach you the most important pieces of building apps for
Teams. You will learn what types of apps you can build for Teams and how
to use the available tools. This learning path is a part of preparation
for a Microsoft 365 developer certification.

path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-msteams-associate/?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka)

### [Microsoft Teams developer documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/overview?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka)

Another great place to start is the developer documentation. It's a
complete reference of the different development capabilities on the
Teams platform. You will find in there everything from a high-level
overview of what you can build on Teams to the detailed specification of
the different features. What's cool about learning from the docs is
that you can choose your own path and which topics you want to learn
first.

documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/overview?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka)

### [Teams app templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka) 

One way to learn is to see what's possible and what others build. If
you want to get inspired, see what's possible or look at how you could
implement a specific scenario, you should check out the [Teams app
templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka).
There are over 40 sample ready-to-use apps including their source code
for you to explore!

### [Tutorials for the Microsoft Teams developer platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/tutorials/get-started-dotnet-app-studio?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka) 

A part of the docs are tutorials for the Teams developer platform. If
you want to get hands-on, this is a great place to start. You can find
tutorials showing apps built using different technologies like Node.js
or C#. And don't forget to check out [code
samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples) too!

### [Microsoft 365 PnP Community](https://pnp.github.io/) 

Microsoft 365 has a vibrant community that supports each other in
building apps on Microsoft 365. We share our experiences through regular
community calls, offer guidance, record videos, share sample apps, and
build tools to speed up development. You can find everything we have to
offer at [aka.ms/m365pnp](https://aka.ms/m365pnp).

## today 

Over 250 million users work with Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams plays
a key role in people's workdays. By integrating your app with Teams you
bring it to where people already are and make it a part of their daily
routine.
Give Teams a try and I'm curious to hear what you've built. And if you
have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them on our community forums
at
[aka.ms/m365pnp-community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp/ct-p/Microsoft365PnP?WT.mc_id=m365-15200-wmastyka).
