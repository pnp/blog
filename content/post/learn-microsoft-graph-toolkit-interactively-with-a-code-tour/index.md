Learn interactively how to turn your React app into a Microsoft 365 app
with Microsoft Graph Toolkit

## The easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365

Using [Microsoft Graph
Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/overview?WT.mc_id=m365-33009-wmastyka)
is the easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365. Toolkit's
components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show
it in your app in [any way you
want](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/customize-components/templates?WT.mc_id=m365-33009-wmastyka).
And with toolkit's [authentication
providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers/providers?WT.mc_id=m365-33009-wmastyka),
setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again
fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web
requests, and dealing with errors.

## Learn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively

To help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how
you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new [learning
path](https://learn.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-msgraph-toolkit/?WT.mc_id=m365-33009-wmastyka)
on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn
everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But
that's not all.

Thinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched
an experiment - an [interactive code
tour](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/mgt-react-codetour) that you can
follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.

By following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty
React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft
365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of
your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the
code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly
experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if
you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building
tours for other technologies and scenarios?
