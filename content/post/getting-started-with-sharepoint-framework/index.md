Using SharePoint Framework you can extend portals on Microsoft 365 and
expose your apps where people work. Here are some resources to get you
started.

## What is SharePoint Framework and why should you care

SharePoint Framework is a development model for building apps on
Microsoft 365. Originally, it started as a way to extend SharePoint
portals. Nowadays, it allows you to also build apps for Microsoft Teams.
When you use SharePoint Framework to build your apps, you don't need to
worry about hosting and auth. You can build your app using any
client-side framework you want and easily deploy your app to your users.

## Resources for getting started with SharePoint Framework

Here is a list of resources to help you get started with building apps
using the SharePoint Framework.

### [Introduction to customizing and extending SharePoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-sharepoint-framework/?WT.mc_id=m365-14993-wmastyka) (learn module)

If you like a structured way of learning, this is the best place to
start. This learn module takes you through the basics of what SharePoint
Framework is, what kind of apps it allows you to build and how to do it.
This module is a part of a larger [learning
path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-extend-fundamental/?WT.mc_id=m365-14993-wmastyka)
that allows you to get certified as a Microsoft 365 developer.

### [Hands-on tutorials for SharePoint development](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/training/training?WT.mc_id=m365-14993-wmastyka)

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, the SharePoint development
tutorials and training are another great place to start. There are both
written and recorded walkthroughs presenting the different aspects of
building solutions using SharePoint Framework. They're kept up-to-date
with the latest version of SharePoint Framework so it's a great
resource for you to bookmark.

### [SharePoint development docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview?WT.mc_id=m365-14993-wmastyka)

Once you're past the basics, the official SharePoint Framework is a
great place to deepen your knowledge. In the docs you will find
explanation of the different capabilities and how they work. The docs
also offer prescriptive guidance on topics such as how to implement
SharePoint Framework in development teams or what enterprise
organizations should take into account.

### [Microsoft 365 Community](https://pnp.github.io/)

Microsoft 365 has a vibrant community that supports each other in
building apps on Microsoft 365. We share our experiences through regular
community calls, offer guidance, record videos and build tools to speed
up development. You can find everything we have to offer at
[aka.ms/m365pnp](https://aka.ms/m365pnp).

## Start building your apps on Microsoft 365 today

Over 250 million users work with Microsoft 365 and using SharePoint
Framework is an easy way to bring your application to where people are.
I'd encourage you to check out the resources I mentioned and give
SharePoint Framework a try. And if you have any questions, don't
hesitate to ask them on our community forums at
