Sounds cool üòé? Let's see some new enhancements we added in this minor release

## Performance improvements through image compression

Extension size matters, especially when it comes to download times and update speed. We have optimized the entire extension by compressing all images without any noticeable quality loss, reducing the overall package size significantly. This means faster installations, quicker updates, and a more responsive experience for everyone using the SPFx Toolkit.

## Updated Adaptive Card Designer link

The Adaptive Card Designer has moved to its new official Microsoft home! We have updated all references throughout the extension from `https://adaptivecards.io/designer/` to the new URL `https://adaptivecards.microsoft.com/designer`. The old designer site now displays a migration banner, and our update ensures you are always directed to the current, officially supported designer with updated features and better integration with the Microsoft ecosystem.

## Fixed image rendering in sample gallery

Documentation and sample galleries are only useful when you can actually see what's being explained. We have fixed broken image links in the README and sample gallery that were preventing proper rendering across environments like SharePoint. The fix updates relative paths to use `raw.githubusercontent.com`, ensuring that all screenshots, diagrams, and visual guides display correctly whether you are viewing them in VS Code, on GitHub, or in the sample gallery detail view.

## App Catalog view no longer shows deleted sites

Clarity in your App Catalog view is essential for effective app management. Previously, deleted or archived sites could still appear in the catalog view, causing confusion when trying to manage your apps. This issue has been resolved by adding a new option to the underlying CLI for Microsoft 365 command that filters out app catalogs from archived or deleted sites. Now the view accurately reflects only your active app catalogs, making it easier to focus on what matters.

## New app management actions: copy and move

Managing apps across multiple app catalogs just got significantly easier. We have added two powerful new actions that streamline common administrative workflows:

- Copy app: Duplicate an app from one app catalog to another, perfect for promoting solutions from development to production environments or distributing apps across multiple site collections
- Move app: Relocate an app entirely from one catalog to another when you need to reorganize your app distribution

These actions eliminate the tedious process of manually downloading apps, re-uploading them to different catalogs, and reconfiguring settings. Now you can manage your apps directly from the SPFx Toolkit interface.

## CLI for Microsoft 365 package cleanup

Every kilobyte counts in extension bundles. We have added a cleanup process for the CLI for Microsoft 365 npm package that removes unnecessary files like documentation, spec.js test files, and js.map source maps from the final VS Code extension bundle. This housekeeping task keeps the extension lean and ensures faster load times without sacrificing any functionality.

## Enhanced Language Model Tool for SharePoint page creation

The `spo_page_add` Language Model Tool has been significantly updated to follow new standards and support more capabilities when creating SharePoint pages through GitHub Copilot. As part of this improvement, all Language Model Tools have been reorganized into subcatalogs for better structure and maintainability as the collection grows. The tool now includes updated and additional input parameters that were previously missing, making page creation through AI more powerful and reliable. When you ask Copilot to create a SharePoint page, the tool now provides more accurate results with better parameter handling.

## Improved sample gallery reliability

The sample gallery is one of the most beloved features of SPFx Toolkit, providing instant access to hundreds of community-contributed web parts, extensions, and Adaptive Card Extension samples. To make this feature even more robust, we have added try-catch safeguards around tags and authors filtering. These protective blocks prevent errors when collections are defined as `null` instead of empty arrays in the JSON data, ensuring the gallery remains responsive and functional even when encountering unexpected data structures or network issues.

## üëè You ROCK ü§©

This release would not have been possible without the help of some really awesome folks who stepped in and joined our journey in creating the best-in-class SharePoint Framework tooling in the world. We would like to express our huge gratitude and shout out to:

- [Adam W√≥jcik](https://github.com/Adam-it)
- [Luccas Castro](https://github.com/DevPio)
- [Saurabh Tripathi](https://github.com/Saurabh7019)

## üó∫Ô∏è Future roadmap

We don't plan to stop, we are already thinking of more awesome features we plan to deliver with v5 release. If you want to check what we are planning, check out our [issues from this milestone](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/milestone/6). Feedback is appreciated üëç.

## üëç Power of the community

This extension would not have been possible if it hadn‚Äôt been for the awesome work done by the [Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community](https://pnp.github.io/). Each sample gallery: SPFx web parts & extensions, and ACE samples & scenarios, is populated with the contributions made by the community. Many of the functionalities of the extension, like upgrading, validating, and deploying your SPFx project, would not have been possible if it weren‚Äôt for the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) tool. I would like to thank all of our awesome contributors sincerely! Creating this extension would not have been possible if it weren‚Äôt for the enormous work done by the community. You all rock ü§©.
