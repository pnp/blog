ðŸ‘‹ Hey, fellow developers!

You like to #NeverStopLearning and feel that #SharingIsCaring? Then this here is exactly for you! Today, I have the great honor to announce the Teams Toolkit Cloud Skills challenge, which I host for you.

It is an amazing opportunity to take your app development skills to the next level!

## Join us!

- Join us from April 12 to April 26 and participate in the challenge to complete the learn path [aka.ms/LearnTeamsToolkit](https://aka.ms/LearnTeamsToolkit).

Not only will you enhance your skills to develop apps for Teams, but you will also be eligible to win fab prizes. The following prizes will be awarded: Ten (10) Grand Prize winners. Each winner will receive the choice of either a $100 digital gift card or $100 Azure credits. Approximate Retail Value (ARV) $1000.

By completing the learn path, you will learn how to leverage Teams Toolkit, a Visual Studio Code extension to build apps for Teams, covered by five modules:

- [Get started building apps for Microsoft Teams by using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/teams-toolkit-vsc-introduction/)
- [Build a bot by using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/teams-toolkit-vsc-create-bot/)

With that, they provide a comprehensive and in-depth experience that covers everything you need to know to get started building apps for Teams.

With Teams Toolkit, you can streamline the app development process and make the most of the platform's features, including creating bots that can automate tasks, developing tabs that can display information from external services, and building message extensions that enable users to interact with external services from within Teams.
