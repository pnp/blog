## Hello World

Let us introduce our new Microsoft 365 and Power Platform Community Blog to you! After a year on Tech Community we decided to make a move towards GitHub,  

* to better align our efforts that span initiatives that provide samples, guidance, training, tools, encouragement
* to provide you with a more pleasantly authoring experience


## What changes
 
* We migrated<sup>1</sup> the existing articles from [TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/bg-p/Microsoft365PnPBlog) to this location
* We will publish new articles including Community Call recording blogs, podcast blogs, monthly updates only here
* The Tech Community hub will retire - we won't accept new content there anymore

If you don't feel comfortable using GitHub, please sign up for an interactive training on how to contribute in our [Sharing Is Caring](https://aka.ms/sharing-is-caring) initiative.


## What won't change
 
* We will continue to celebrate learning and sharing knowledge
* We will continue to provide guidance, support, encouragement and grow as a community

You are awesome!

*Sharing Is Caring*

<sup>1</sup> still work in progress, let us know in the [issues](https://github.com/pnp/blog/issues) if something is missing or off.
