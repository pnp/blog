[Original Post](https://unsuckm365.com/2025/05/14/the-microsoft-365-conference-and-how-you-still-owe-it-to-yourself-going-to-the-next-one/)

Three years ago, I wrote about why anyone working in the Microsoft 365 space *should* attend the [Microsoft 365 Conference](https://unsuckm365.com/2022/04/16/the-microsoft-365-conference-and-how-you-owe-it-to-yourself-going-to-the-next-one/) (now the Community Conference). Last week, once again, I was off to Las Vegas, to attend this year's edition of the same event. Little did I know, that earlier message would only grow stronger over time, but this time around, things would feel different.

## A Personal Transformation

Back in late 2021, as the world cautiously emerged from pandemic lockdowns, I took a leap and attended my very first Microsoft 365 event. I had no idea at the time just how much that experience would shape my career—and how it would launch me into an entirely new chapter as a community speaker myself. Since then, so much has changed and the role of the M365 Community has taken center stage in my life – literally this community has saved me. But more about that another time. For now, it will suffice to say that I am more confident than I have ever been and I have no fear of expressing myself and fully embracing my awkwardness while feeling completely comfortable in my own skin.

I’ve written about this more than once before (in 2022 for both [Microsoft 365](https://unsuckm365.com/2022/04/16/the-microsoft-365-conference-and-how-you-owe-it-to-yourself-going-to-the-next-one/) and [Power Platform](https://unsuckm365.com/2022/09/27/my-takeaways-from-the-power-platform-conference/), and again [in 2024](https://unsuckm365.com/2024/05/06/my-microsoft-365-conference-recap-may-2024-edition/)): the real magic of tech conferences happens in the hallways, over coffee, during dinners, and in the side conversations that are not on the official schedule. These are where ideas are born, problems are solved, and genuine friendships are built.

## The People Who Matter

At the M365 Community Conference in Las Vegas last week, I had the opportunity to speak with [Christian Buckley](https://buckleyplanet.com)—someone I once looked up to as an industry icon, and who I now consider a mentor and friend. I had the chance to compliment him on his recent article, [“Why I Keep Showing Up to Tech Conferences”](https://buckleyplanet.com), where he writes so powerfully about the long-term value of showing up, being present, and building relationships over time. That message deeply resonates with me. Christian—and so many others I once admired from afar—have become an essential part of my journey, not just as peers, but as mentors who’ve generously shared their wisdom and encouragement. It would be unfair to make a list of everyone but I will try my best to recognize who they are from time to time and the great impact they had and continue to have on me.

So back on why things felt different this time. Finally, the once so vivid memories of the pandemic are far behind us. The world is still a dark place and there is still so much work to be done. Two MAJOR new kids arrived and are now here to stay: I am looking at you Power Platform and Copilot. Nonetheless, work is now full steam ahead and the AI revolution has become omnipresent these days.

## Be Present!

Another important thing for me is that by attending these events, I ensure my voice is heard. The little Diego, that was born and raised in Brazil, could only dream to be in a room helping shape up the conversation about the technology he has always been so passionate about. Having worked for so many years in spaces where I had to put my head down, I am finally able to speak up and make my voice heard.

## That Awkward Budget Conversation

Some conferences can be pricey, and I understand that it’s not always easy to make the case to employers—especially when in-person training isn’t always seen as a top priority and with ever decreasing budgets. But there are also plenty of incredible free, local events, most of which are listed at [CommunityDays.org](https://www.communitydays.org). Whether you’re just getting started or looking to reconnect with the community, these local gatherings are a great way to plug in without needing a big travel budget – or any budget at all.

## Looking Ahead

I hope to see you on the road and look forward to the many memories and connections that are still to be made. And if you haven’t yet made the leap, it’s not just an option—you owe it to yourself to attend the next one.

As for me, I will continue engaging with this amazing community and I am already looking forward to the next one, being the [European Collaboration Summit](https://www.collabsummit.eu) in less than two weeks. Also another [Power Platform Conference](https://powerplatformconf.com) this fall, and the already announced [Microsoft 365 Conference](https://m365conf.com/) in 2026. So bring it on!!!
