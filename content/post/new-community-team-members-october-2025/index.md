We are excited to announce that we are growing our virtual [Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community coordination team](https://aka.ms/community/team) with additional community members. This virtual community team is responsible of the different [Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community](https://aka.ms/community/home) activities in different community channels, including our open-source work in the GitHub. 

This team consists of Microsoft employees and community members (MVPs) **focused on helping the community** with the best use of Microsoft products, like Microsoft Copilot, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Viva, Power Platform, OneDrive, SharePoint, or API layer like Microsoft Graph.

We believe that by **working together as one unified team across the organization barriers**, we can make even larger worldwide impact and help other community members to succeed in adopting different practices within Microsoft 365 & Power Platform areas. **Better together with shared objectives**, not in isolation.

We are **always looking for active contributors and coordinators on this team**. If you are interested in getting involved, reach out to team members and we will find you a suitable path to support your journey.

*‚ÄúWe are committed on building the best tech community in the world where everyone feels welcome, and we help to empower each and every community member to achieve more.‚Äù üß°*

Thank you for being part of this incredible community!

## Jan Chlebek - Power Platform Tech Lead

![Jan Chlebek](images/jan-chlebek.png)

You can recognize me by the humorous toast character graphics that occasionally appear on your LinkedIn feed. Why? Because my Polish surname (Chlebek) can be directly translated to "Breadman". I've always been passionate about teaching others, and being a Clouds On Mars Tech Lead for Power Platform in a highly competitive consulting environment has helped me thrive in the last five years of my IT career.
 
With a passion for sharing knowledge, I pursue blogging, public conference speaking (on Business Application development - Power Platform, AI & Web Development), and contributing to various content repositories such as [Power Platform Samples](http://aka.ms/powerplatform-samples) and [Power Platform Snippets](http://aka.ms/powerplatform-snippets). That's where you can find me in the PnP world!

You will find Jan on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/jan-chlebek)

## Martin Machacek - .NET developer

![Martin Machacek](images/martin-machacek.png)

Martin is a .NET developer at Edhouse with a strong focus on Microsoft 365 development, which he initially encountered by chance. He quickly became engaged with the vibrant M365 and PnP community, recognizing the immense value of its resources and collaborative spirit. Passionate about knowledge sharing, Martin contributes actively through his technical blog and as a contributor and maintainer of the [CLI for Microsoft 365 repository](aka.ms/cli-m365).

## Nico De Cleyre - Team Coach & M365 Architect/Developer, MVP

![Nico De Cleyre](images/nico-de-cleyre.png)

My journey into the Microsoft world actually started completely by accident üòÖ During my summer job, the HR recruiter suddenly asked if I'd be interested in a position as a SharePoint Developer. SharePoint? No clue what that was! But I thought: "why not, let's discover what this is all about". Looking back... best decision ever! üôå

From SharePoint Developer, I grew into an M365 Developer and eventually into an M365 Architect. Today, I help organizations at ConXioN with their migration to M365, tackle their Purview compliance and security, and make sure their governance is on point. On top of that, I train and inspire teams to work with Copilot and develop SPFx solutions and Copilot Agents myself.

SPFx... that's my second love üíô When I get to develop in SPFx, time just flies by. I'm such a fan that I'm actually one of the maintainers of the [SharePoint Framework Toolkit repository](https://aka.ms/spfx/code). Giving back to the community where I learned so much myself, that just feels right!

Outside of work? You'll probably find me with my family - my wife, 2 kids, and our mini zoo of 4 dogs, 1 cat, 1 turtle, 2 rabbits, and 3 chickens üêïüêàüê¢üê∞üêì Or I'm somewhere in the mountains hiking, usually in the Ardennes. That's where my head gets some rest and I can recharge for new SPFx adventures!

## Saurabh Tripathi - M365 Solutions Architect, MVP

![Saurabh Tripathi ](images/saurabh-tripathi.png)

Saurabh is a Microsoft 365 Solutions Architect at AFRY, Sweden. He started his career as a SharePoint developer and has benefited from the community's work in many ways. When someone in the community mentioned that we should contribute to the tools we use, it resonated with him and inspired him to start giving back. Active in the community since 2023, Saurabh sees contributing to PnP repos an important part of his work and life.

 Saurabh is one of the maintainers of the [SharePoint Framework Toolkit repository](https://aka.ms/spfx/code) which helps to streamline development of Microsoft 365 solutions.

## Tom Daly - Community Builder, Developer, MVP, and Microsoft 365 Enthusiast

![Tom Daly](images/tom-daly.png)

Hi, I‚Äôm Tom Daly, and my career in technology began nearly two decades ago when I first discovered the power of community through weekend events, forum posts, and CodePlex contributions. From those early days, I realized how transformative it was to share and learn from one another ‚Äî and that spirit of collaboration has stayed with me ever since.
 
My background is rooted in SharePoint and Microsoft 365 development, where collaboration and innovation go hand in hand. Over the years, I‚Äôve contributed to numerous GitHub repositories, PnP initiatives, and other open-source projects, while also blogging to help others navigate the Microsoft ecosystem.
 
I was honored to be recognized as a Microsoft MVP for Microsoft 365 Apps & Development in 2017. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve organized and hosted more than 50+ community events ‚Äî including SharePoint Saturdays, M365 events, Azure Boot Camps, and Power Platform Boot Camps ‚Äî all centered around empowering others to learn, connect, and grow.
 
My most recent contribution is [CommunityDays.org](https://www.communitydays.org/), a platform built to bring speakers, organizers, sponsors, and attendees together ‚Äî creating a home for the next generation of community-driven events.
 
Away from the keyboard, I‚Äôm all about family time ‚Äî weekend adventures, spontaneous projects, and creating moments with my wife and two daughters that matter most.
