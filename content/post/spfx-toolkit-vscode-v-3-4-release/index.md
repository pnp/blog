Sounds cool üòé? Let's see some new enhancements we added in this minor release

## Learn SharePoint Framework

One of SharePoint Framework Toolkit main aims is to help you get started and learn SPFx. It is very important to make it as easy as possible for devs who are just starting their journey with SharePoint Framework Development. For that reason, the extension has a walkthrough which basically is a step-by-step guide that will introduce you to SharePoint Framework in general and to this toolkit capabilities. In this release, we spent some time improving this experience providing even more valuable learning information.

## Improved Sample Gallery

SharePoint Framework Toolkit Sample Gallery allows you to find a solution for your problem quickly. Why would you start from scratch if you may use one of 400+ samples as your starting point all ready to kick off your work? In this release, we added some fixes and improvements to this functionality, along with really great enhancements that allow you to see selected filters as tags and modify them with ease.

## üëè You ROCK ü§©

This release would not have been possible without the help of some really awesome folks who stepped in and joined our journey in creating the best in class SharePoint Framework tooling in the world. We would like to express our huge gratitude and shout out to:

- [Saurabh Tripathi](https://github.com/Saurabh7019)
- [Luccas Castro](https://github.com/DevPio)

## üó∫Ô∏è Future roadmap

We don't plan to stop, we are already thinking of more awesome features we plan to deliver with v4 release. If you want to check what we are planning or add your own idea please [join the discussion](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/discussions/159). Feedback is appreciated üëç.

## üëç Power of the community

This extension would not have been possible if it weren‚Äôt for the awesome work done by the [Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community](https://pnp.github.io/). Each sample gallery: SPFx web parts & extensions, and ACE samples & scenarios are all populated with the contributions done by the community. Many of the functionalities of the extension like upgrading, validating, and deploying your SPFx project, would not have been possible if it wasn‚Äôt for the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) tool. I would like to sincerely thank all of our awesome contributors! Creating this extension would not have been possible if it weren‚Äôt for the enormous work done by the community. You all rock ü§©.
