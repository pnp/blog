Microsoft 365 Platform Community (PnP) June 2022 update is out with a summary of the latest guidance, samples, and solutions from Microsoft or from the community for the community. This article is a summary of all the different areas and topics around the community work we do around Microsoft 365 ecosystem during the past month. Thank you for being part of this success.

_We are committed on building the best tech community in the world where everyone feels welcome and we help to empower each and every community member to achieve more._

## What is Microsoft 365 Platform Community

Microsoft 365 Platform Community is community activities coordinated by numerous teams inside of the Microsoft 365 engineering organizations. This is a community-driven open-source initiative where Microsoft and external community members are sharing their learning's around implementation practices for Microsoft 365.

Topics vary from Microsoft Viva, Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Teams, Power Platform, OneDrive and SharePoint. Active development and contributions happen in GitHub by providing contributions to the samples, reusable components, and documentation for various areas. PnP is owned and coordinated by Microsoft engineering, but this is work done by the community for the community.

See more details from New Microsoft 365 Platform (PnP) team model with new community leads

The initiative is facilitated by Microsoft, but we have multiple community members as part of the platform community team (see team details in end of the article) and we are always looking to grow the Platform Community team with more community members. Notice that since this is open-source community initiative, so there’s no SLAs for the support for the samples provided through GitHub. Obviously, all officially released components and libraries are under official support from Microsoft.

## What's supportability story around the community tooling and assets?

Following statements apply across all of the community lead and contributed samples and solutions, including samples, core component(s) and solutions, like SharePoint Starter Kit, yo teams or PnP PowerShell. All Microsoft released SDKs and tools are supported based on the specific tool policies.

*   PnP guidance and samples are created by Microsoft & by the Community
*   PnP guidance and samples are maintained by Microsoft & community
*   PnP uses supported and recommended techniques
*   PnP is an open-source initiative by the community – people who work on the initiative for the benefit of others, have their normal day job as well
*   PnP is NOT a product and therefore it’s not supported by Premier Support or other official support channels
*   PnP is supported in similar ways as other open source projects done by Microsoft with support from the community by the community
*   There are numerous partners that utilize PnP within their solutions for customers. Support for this is provided by the Partner. When PnP material is used in deployments, we recommend being clear with your customer/deployment owner on the support model

Please see the specifics on the supportability on the tool, SDK or component repository or download page.

## Microsoft 365 Platform Community team model

![Teammodel ](images/teammodel.png)

In April 2020 we announced our new [Microsoft 365 PnP team model](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/new-microsoft-365-patterns-and-practices-pnp-team-model-with-new-community-leads/) and grew the MVP team quite significantly. PnP model exists for having more efficient engagement between Microsoft engineering and community members. Let's build things together. Your contributions and feedback is always welcome! During August, we also crew the team with 5 new members. PnP Team coordinates and leads the different open-source and community efforts we execute in the Microsoft 365 platform.

We welcome all community members to get involved on the community and open-source efforts. Your input do matter!

## ⚙ Area-specific updates

These are different areas which are closely involved on the community work across the PnP initiative. Some are lead and coordinated by engineering organizations, some are coordinated by the community and MVPs.

### Microsoft Graph Toolkit

![Microsoft Graph Toolkit ](images/mgt.png)

Microsoft Graph Toolkit is engineering lead initiative, which works closely with the community on the open-source areas. The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic web components and helpers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.

*   Latest version currently is 2.5.2
*   [mgt.dev](https://mgt.dev/?path=/story/components-mgt-agenda--simple) - Microsoft Graph Toolkit Playground
*   [Getting started with Microsoft Graph Toolkit guidance video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbAZHvB5NEk) from developer community call by [Beth Pan](https://twitter.com/beth_panx) (Microsoft)
*   Latest code and preview versions from [https://aka.ms/mgt](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-toolkit)

All the latest updates on the Microsoft Graph Toolkit is being presented in our bi-weekly Microsoft 365 Generic Dev community call, including the latest community contributors.

### Microsoft 365 Community Docs

![Community Docs ](images/communitydocs.png)

### Independent Connectors Program

![Independent publishers](images/independent-publishers.png)

Microsoft Power Platform comes with a huge variety of already built-in connectors and also provides you with the ability of creating your own custom connectors. As of July 2021, anyone can submit the connectors they built to Microsoft Power Platform so that they can be used by others as well. Previously, only API owners could publish their connectors. The Independent Publisher Connector Program's mission is to bring the best together: the best people, connecting great ideas to data, apps, and flows. We want to make it easier for connector developers to collaborate on connectors.

For more information, you can watch this video on [Publish a connector to the Publish a connector to the Power Platform with Independent Publisher Conn...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulTBvCHw8MU) and check out [Microsoft Power Platform Connectors](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors) on GitHub
