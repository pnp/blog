### Demos

* **Building React Taxonomy File Explorer experience with SPFx** – render and manipulate files (Drag&Drop), folders, sub-folders in a hierarchical view based on managed metadata. Web part built with SPFx v1.15 and PnPjs. One can Move, Copy and/or Link to files in folders and also enables moving documents into library from an external location. Uses PnPjs to retrieve terms. File hierarchy is collapsible. Step through React component structures including the master TaxonomyFileExplorer component.
* **Introduction to new Viva Connections Toolkit VS Code extension to streamline your development** – after months of work, the toolkit is available now. Streamline your development process. See how to access and install the pre-release version of this new toolkit. Create a Viva project from a clean slate, from a scenario with CodeTour guidance or from an example (sample). Check for and install dependencies (Node.js., npm and npm dependencies). Now we need your feedback please.
