### Demos

* **The Canary in the coalmine or how to keep an eye on the SharePoint Search updates** – a simple brute force solution that addresses unadvertised search outages that affect customer’s search result accuracy – site performance. The early warning system monitors search refresh - site indexing activities using an Azure function to compare SharePoint list and index values every 5 minutes. If values don’t match after 30 minutes, email is sent to the admin account.
* **Building Service Health solution for Microsoft 365 with SharePoint Framework** – a SPFx web part that uses the Graph API to display the health status for all Microsoft 365 services as seen only by Admins in Admin Center, presently. The web part delivers a similar appearance and drill down functionality as in Admin center. Web part broken into multiple sub-components with separate styling for code manageability/reuse. Many of the components are stateless.
* **Introduction to hTWOo v2.0 - a better Fluent UI framework** – created 2 years ago. There are 2 flavors of hTWOo 2.0 (hTWOo-core (html/CSS/js), and hTWOo-react (components)). Changes from 1.0 – no breaking changes, completely rewrote the library internal to CSS in SASS-dart, completely revamped website, and more. See how to get hTWOo into your SPFx project. Step through pulling a button and an accordion item into your project. Q&A - modern browser support, using hTWOo outside SPFx.

The host of this call is [Garry Trinder](https://twitter.com/garrytrinder) (Microsoft) \| @garrytrinder. Q&A takes place as always in chat throughout the call.
