### Demos

* **Getting started with PnPjs in SPFx solutions** – explanation on files/code in a PnPjs v3.x sample. Items called out - changes between v2 and v3, dependencies, pnpjsConfig file (importing only selected bits of functionality libraries), chaining behaviors together, establishing global context for factory interfaces, caching, loadUser method (get information from Graph), rendering, creating a batched instance for grouped updates, discussion on approach to structure of production vs sample code.
* **Building ISV offering for Microsoft Viva with SPFx ACEs and multi-tenant APIs hosted in Azure** – capabilities in SPFx v1.15 make it easy (as in automate) for your customer to register, manage consent and deploy your SaaS app/ACE in their tenant. Step through configuration for managing a multi-tenant deployment including app registration in Azure AD, hosting multi-tenant aware back-end services on Azure, consent, permissions, etc. Understand architectural challenges and see an ACE on multiple tenants interact with the back-end multi-tenant API.
