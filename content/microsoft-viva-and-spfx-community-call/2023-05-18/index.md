Full bundle of capabilities includes webparts, extensions, library, PnP and customizable SharePoint provisioning templates for sites, pages, content + documentation. Uses SPFx v1.16.1, Fluent UI, PnPjs v3.11. Normalized coding approaches. Integrations with related products. Stand up an example site in less than 10 minutes. All open-source.
* **Creating custom SPFx components for Microsoft Viva Connections for Education** – targeting the student persona. Viva Connections for Education (student’s digital home dashboard with cards for resource access, student-teacher connections, and more), EDU specific code samples (tuition fees, library loans, book a space, internships, scholarships), Adoption Toolkit (Best practices for Viva Connections Adoption, Day in a life for a student using VCE, Communication templates and documentation) what’s next?
* **SPFx framework at Microsoft - Accelerator Domain Models** – understand the "SPFx Solution Accelerator" framework by going deep into the Rhythm of the Business Calendar sample app to see patterns and practices for building enterprise-class apps on SharePoint. This accelerator, inspired by Domain Driven Design, has evolved since SPFx v1.0. Today’s focus is on “Entities” (including class, relationships, validation, categories and states) and the implementation of a rich entity domain model for your application.
