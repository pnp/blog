## Call summary

Welcome to the bi-weekly call focused on Microsoft 365 client-side development.  In this call, we focus on using Viva Connections and SharePoint Framework to build solutions for Microsoft Teams and SharePoint Online.

### Demos

* **Building custom accordion Tabs experience with rich text experiences** – this web part allows users to create and manage content laid out in tabbed or accordion format for both desktop and mobile. Switch between views using Property Field Collection Data and edit content with tinyMCE Rich Text Editor for SharePoint Online. Uses Custom Accordion components and Custom Tab components included in the code. Also uses primary colors and themes from host site.
* **Using Microsoft Graph Profile API in SPFx for awards web part experience** – shows user profile and awards courtesy of the recently released beta Microsoft Graph profile endpoint. Awards is an example of new information (skills, projects, languages…) you can attach to a user’s profile using Graph. Sample shows title, description, badge and link to more information about award. See using Postman to add an award. Uses the me endpoint to get list of awards.
* **Adaptive Cards Extensions strategy pattern for multi-action QuickView** – with complex ACE’s, handling many conditional quick view onActions (many if action.id statements), can seriously complicate code. Example scenario – exposing news items with next and previous actions, options to like and comment, and the ability to post news in a Teams channel. Move from many onActions to a single action with refactoring. See how acions are handled/combined by the ActionExecutor!
