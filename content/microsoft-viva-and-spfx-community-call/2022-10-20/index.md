### Demos

* **Copy Views SharePoint Framework Web Part** – copy views from one list/library to another using either the new web part or extension. Copy columns, sorting, group by, view formatting and filtering. Web part displayed on specific site/page for view management purposes. Extension is a dialog opened by ListView Command set extension on any list/library - tenant wide or site scoped. Code - see component structure and PnPjs copy functionality.
* **Using the Azure AD on-behalf-of flow within your SharePoint Framework solution** – overview of On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow, tokens, permissions and use in SharePoint Framework. OBO is great for when you need a background task running (in middleware that needs to consume another back-end service like Microsoft Graph) on-behalf-of a user that triggers the middleware from a SharePoint Framework app. 2 OBO scenarios shown - get my personal data via OBO and send Teams chat message via OBO.
