### Demos

* **Building Frequently Asked Questions web part with Property Field Collection Data** – configure the FAQ web part’s layout in property pane - select accordion or tab, colors and themes. Create categories and sort conditions. Use the rich text editor to easily answer questions. Uses Office UI Fabric Search Box - search by question, searched term highlighted in results. See code for the 2 components (FAQ and Accordion) in web part. Accordion is a custom component.
* **Solve Teams and SharePoint Theme problems with the "Enhanced Theme Provider" control for SPFx solutions** – introduction to the “Enhanced Theme Provider” control, what problem it solves (lack of support for Teams high contrast theme and basic styles), how it’s implemented, and how to use it in SPFx. Extends functionality of the Fluent UI ThemeProvider control by adding some logic and considered as a sort-of wrapper for all react and non-react controls that you want to add to the WebPart.
* **Getting started on building custom list form components with SPFx v1.15** – introducing a new component type in v1.15 called Form customizer. Enabling development of custom modern forms with custom edit experience. Delivering API level support for content types with 6 new properties for separately configuring new form, edit form and display form. Look at how to debug your form customizer and how form customizer will work in your production environment. Review List extensibility roadmap.
