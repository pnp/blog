### Demos

* **Manage data in OneDrive application folder** - do you need to store user personal data generated by your SPFx app located within SharePoint and Teams? See how to manage data stored in a json file in the application’s personal folder on the user’s OneDrive. Three Microsoft Graph end points are used in this solution. Graph conveniently creates the data file on your OneDrive for you. Step through the web part code.
* **Auto Batching Microsoft Graph Calls in your SPFx solutions** - auto-batching Microsoft Graph requests in SPFx and especially in Adaptive Cards scenarios where throttling may be an issue with many consecutive requests, is simple and more efficient. Marcin has defined an interface IHttp Client. See how he queues up and sends batched requests. Thorough code walk-through includes logic to test batch requests. Hear his rationale behind using AadHttpClient instead of MSGraphClient.
* **SPFx Design Patterns – Property pane exception handling** - avoid making your users feel bad through poor information collection design. In this 6th and final installment on property panes, use proven PnP property pane controls and validation methods in your reusable SPFx solutions. Step through installing the propertypane library in your VS code environment, than add and configure a control in a web part. Session wraps with design (error message) etiquette recommendations.
