## Call summary

Welcome to the bi-weekly call focused on Microsoft 365 client-side development.  In this call, we focus on using Viva Connections and SharePoint Framework to build solutions for Microsoft Teams and SharePoint Online.

### New this week

* Agenda set for next [Microsoft 365 platform call](https://aka.ms/m365-dev-call) - Tuesday, January 3, 2023, 8:00 am PT.
    * During the holiday season, the calls have been transformed into coffee & tea with the community meetings – Q&A and discussions and without specific demos and agenda. Please join as you are able.
* Project releases
    * Viva Connections Toolkit for VS Code – v0.2.2 (preview)
        * Install directly from the VS Code extensions tab. With the Viva Connections Toolkit extension, you can create and manage your Viva Connections solutions in your tenant. All actions you need to perform during the development flow are at your fingertips. Note: Works with any SPFx solution.

### Demos

* **Building SPFx Password Vault Web Part and SharePoint quick links extension for browser** – two solutions are presented here. From idea and design criteria to code and demos for the Password Vault web part (encrypted password protected page and data) and for the SharePoint Quicklinks extension (dynamic quick links to site contents, site settings, etc.). Install and configure web part and extension, look at the code – focusing on PasswordValueService for web part and on a single file for extension.
* **My experience as a first-time contributor to CLI for Microsoft 365** – a personal step-by-step experience that includes practical guidance on how to contribute. Creating your local playground, creating a fork, identifying good first issues and types of issues, getting the green light to work on the issue, writing a command, creating a PR and PR approval. The chance to work with maintainers and yes, the sense of addiction you may experience in the process!

The host of this call is [Vesa Juvonen](http://twitter.com/vesajuvonen) (Microsoft) \| @vesajuvonen. Q&A takes place as always in chat throughout the call.
