### Demos

* **Using the Microsoft Graph education endpoints in SPFx to create a my assignments web part** – while using Assignments capability in Microsoft Teams for Education, you may want to render an aggregated list of assignments in SharePoint. That’s now possible using the My Assignments web part carefully explained here. Learn about the education related APIs in Microsoft Graph. EDU specific end points shown: /education/me, /ms/joinedTeams, /education/me/classes, /education/me/assignments. Review API permissions, caching service, refresh technique and capability limitations. Requires Education tenant.
* **Getting started on building custom list form experiences with SharePoint Framework** – a new feature (extension) introduced in SPFx v1.15 for customizing the form experience of a list. Focus on 3 behaviors – create, view and edit items in a list. Render one or more behaviors on a form. Starting with required tools, create a SPFx extension project, review provisioned components/code, 2 MUST use methods, overriding behaviors, creation and rendering options and finally deploying a form to production.
