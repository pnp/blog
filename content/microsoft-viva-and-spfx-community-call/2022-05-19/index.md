### Demos

* **Building Office Locations Viva Connections Adaptive Card Extension with SPFx** – Office locations ACE. See configuring this ACE with multiple card views showing the details of the geographically distributed offices for an organization. Key solution properties: Multiple data sources (local properties, taxonomy, or SharePoint list), Bing and Google for maps, PnP JS v3, OpenWeather API to get weather, Temporal API to get local time, Geolocation action type and Caching. Uses new Show location action.
* **Using Adaptive Cards Designer control from the PnP control gallery in SPFx solutions** – see the new control to be included in the next version of the PnP Reusable React controls library. The control simplifies the use of Designer inside a SPFx web part. Essentially, the Host renders a single Adaptive Card in a web part and on the selected Adaptive Card now is a superimposed button ‘Open Designer’ that brings up the new and SPFx optimized, Designer control.
