* **Huge thanks for Patrick Rodgers on his last call hosting today (for now)**.
    * This was his last time hosting the call as recurrent host based on his personal request. **Patrick started this call back in February 2016** as weekly call as first spin-off from the monthly Office 365 Patterns and Practices community call - see the historical blog post announcement from [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/introducing-office-dev-pnp-office-hours-and-interest-groups/.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/introducing-office-dev-pnp-office-hours-and-interest-groups/)
    * This was few months before Microsoft announced \#SPFx as the new extensibility model for SharePoint Online, so we could not yet talk about the details, but started to push the community towards the right direction. As we started to have gradually bit more structure in our community initiative, call then transformed to be a bi-weekly call on Thursdays later 2016.
    * It's hard to calculate the exact number of the calls Patrick has hosted, but it's somewhere around 100-120 overall calls with conservative estimate. Each call has have on average around 150 attendees, which will sum up overall \>15.000 live attendees in the calls hosted by Patrick.
    * Thank you Patrick on the hosting of these calls. **You have provided help and smiles for thousands of people all around the world and sparked countless of ideas for products or pushed people forward on their career.** You've had undoubtedly massive impact on the success of Microsoft 365 platform all up, but more importantly you've had direct impact on countless people's careers and day to day life. It's been a pleasure to work with you on these calls. 🧡
    * Patrick is not going to disappear from the community topics, but rather wanted to provide other people the opportunity to host the call. So starting from next Viva & SPFx call, we'll have a larger team of MVPs and Microsoft employees who have volunteered to host the call.

### Demos

* **Building polished form experiences with SPFx form customizer** – working back from the final UI to the code behind the scenes, see how to create a custom form component. Steps include create a list or library structure using content types, create a Form Customizer extension project using SPFx, configure and debug, deploy solution to App Catalog, and finally associate the custom component to the content type. This capability is available only using SPFx v1.15.
* **Building SPFx solution with Azure Communication Services integration** – see how pre-built ACS composite chat component is used in a SPFx web part sample called RoomChat built by João Mendes. After an overview of ACS, create a Communications Service. Visit the ACS UI Library (sandbox) – and pick up a chat component. Step through core code elements of the web part. Use property panes or SharePoint Online tenant properties for storing information used by your web part.

The host of this call is [Patrick Rodgers](https://twitter.com/mediocrebowler) (Microsoft) \| @mediocrebowler.  Q&A takes place as always in chat throughout the call.
