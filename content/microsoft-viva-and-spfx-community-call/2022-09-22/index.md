Uses an ACE component type and InageCard template in SPFx v1.15.0. Relies on a SharePoint list with simple schema (title, location, date, image) in back-end. See upcoming holidays in Quick view.
* **Accelerate SPFx development with reusable open-source controls** – overview on available PnP React controls and Property pane controls you can leverage in your SPFx solutions.
