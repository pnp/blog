### New this month

* Monthly Community Tip - Using the Toggle control to create reusable functions! - [Todd Baginski](https://twitter.com/toddbaginski) - (Canviz) \| @toddbaginski

### Demo summaries

* **Building a SharePoint Document Library Approvals System –** move an on-prem Access database solution to cloud. Solution must be secure, accessible from mobile and have multiple approval levels. The flow shown utilizes a SharePoint document library and Approvals to request a file review, approve or reject the file, and update the SharePoint library. Flow addresses "File is Locked" error handling. Finally, see what a Doc Library looks like as Power App!
* **Microsoft Teams Approvals in Dynamics 365 using Power Automate –** opportunity approval in Dynamics 365 Sales using Power Automate, Microsoft Exchange, and Microsoft Teams. Sales enters opportunity that triggers a flow that creates an entry in Approval History table in Dynamics 365. Approval request is transmitted to Team members via e-mail and Teams channel. When opportunity is approved/denied, record in table is updated and status is mailed to salesperson and posted in Teams channel.
* **How to connect Microsoft Dataverse to Microsoft Teams –** save time finding information, use Power Automate to identify customer channels across 100s of Teams, link an account record to a specific Teams channel, and see a dynamic “Open Teams” button on the model-driven app command bar. Accounts and Channels are stored in Dataverse. The Model-driven app allows users to connect an Account to a Teams channel. Rapid yet comprehensive step through flows.
