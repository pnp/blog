### Demo summaries

* **Customer Inventory and Daily Expenses App -** tracks information and
    reduces paperwork by giving managers the ability track/access customer
    records, daily business expenses, pricing, inventory and monitor workflow
    completion, while allowing employees to easily enter data into the app. The
    Power Platform solution uses Dataverse to store data, Power Apps Canvas app
    for data entry, notes and inventory capture, and Power Automate for workflow
    and push notifications.
* **Introduction to Power Apps Portals -** leverage existing model-driven apps
    by building portal apps on top of them. In this demo build a portal app for
    external users with no AAD accounts or access to Power Apps. Create a table,
    create a portal app, create a portal form, build a portal, set permissions,
    create a view and see records as external user. More Portal capabilities in
    future demos.
