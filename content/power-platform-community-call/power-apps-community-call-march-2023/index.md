### Demo summaries

* **From Epilepsy to MVP - Empowerment using the Power Platform** – a personal story meant to inspire viewers. This story begins with a mystery and no cure. After 26 years there is a diagnosis and cure. The message: By learning how to live with a disability, Daniel developed the skills (writing, speaking, teaching, connecting) to be a great MVP. Let disability not define you. As for the link to Power Platform? Enjoy the story. [aka.ms/Mar15-Demo1](https://aka.ms/Mar15-Demo1)
* **Igniting a Power Automate Revolution: What Happens When Salespeople like to Click Buttons?** – a development journey prompted by necessity, a passing awareness of Power Automate and a supportive employer. The journey starts with a single time saving flow, value recognition, and peer adoption. Then blooms with learning and growth, community support, technology challenges overcome, and the full embrace of leadership for both the Maker and Power Platform. This is a practical and implementable journey. [aka.ms/Mar15-Demo2](https://aka.ms/Mar15-Demo2)
* **Quality Assurance with Power Platform Pipelines using Power Apps** – a QA Assessment tool using Power apps built on the Power Platform Pipeline (ALM Accelerator for Power Platform, built by the Power CAT team). The tool (simple canvas app) facilitates the successful transition from Development to QA to UAT after criteria satisfied. App includes pre-built list of checks (assessment items) to perform, by product topic. QA submission closes QA session and allows deployment into UAT environment.
