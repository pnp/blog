### Demo summaries

* **How to get output from a Teams Adaptive card with Power Automate** – use cards to disseminate and collect information or approvals. Learn how the cards deliver a direct output, parsing JSON and storing output with the help of Power Automate. Create card starting in Adaptive Cards Designer and choosing the Microsoft Teams, theme, and target version v1.4 or newer. Walk through the Power Automate flow to post card, collect/store response, send confirming mail in Teams chat.
* **Making HR benefits enrollment more fun with Power Apps, Power Automate & SharePoint** – the authors decided to spice up the open enrollment process by creating an adventure-style game. Uses no premium licensed products - Power Apps (Canvas), Power Automate, SharePoint lists, Microsoft Teams. A Chat person steps user through the process of reviewing a document or video, questions assess viewer’s understanding, move to next step button displayed upon step completion. Results stored in SharePoint List.
* **Deep linking a Power App to replicate InfoPath** – equipment transfer process includes 3 forms / 3 Power Apps coordinated by One Power Automate flow. Forms include capabilities - edit form, change view and e-mail submitter, previously delivered by InfoPath controls. Status of form completion/approval/closure stored in SharePoint list. See user view of forms, step through form code and then through the Power Automate Flow that includes deep link URLs, i.e., from e-mail to forms.
