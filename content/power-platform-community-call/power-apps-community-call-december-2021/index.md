-   Demo 1:  **Building Xbox games with Power Apps --** presenter steps
    through several apps and explains which Xbox sticks and buttons are
    used to navigate app.  Follow along and start to build a game. The
    process:  Set up environment, create a player with attributes, see
    techniques for moving the player around screen, refine movement
    using functions, and rotate player.  Games = manipulate a player
    inside a table.  Games are tables with skins.   Have a bug crawling
    around your screen in no time!

-   Demo 2:  **Office like commenting & co-authoring** -- 2 useful
    collaboration capabilities. Add comments, reply to threads, resolve
    and delete comments, @mention people, and receive an email across
    Power Platform products like done in Office apps.  Roadmap for
    comments GA CYQ1'22, comments in Canvas apps CYQ2'22.   Experimental
    co-authoring with git integration available now (as experimental) in
    canvas apps.    Users intentionally decide when to publish/merge
    edits to shared document.  Update history stored in back-end.
