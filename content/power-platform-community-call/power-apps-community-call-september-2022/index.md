### Demo summaries

* **Parsing JSON in Power Apps** – problem: Receiving information in JSON requires parsing to use it in a Power App. Learn about key-value pairs and RegEx. See a flow that takes a JSON string to parse, inserts information into an HTML table and then sends the result to a Power App – shows up as key value pairs in a gallery. Solution development lessons learned, and resources shared.
* **UX Tips & Tricks for Model-Driven Apps** – as classic Power Apps capabilities are making their way to modern Power Apps and Power Apps Designer, learn about five configuration tips you can implement today to improve user experience in your model-driven apps. Better user experience meaning – user is not overwhelmed with irrelevant information or UI, or the user can make add/edit information in context rather than exiting app to make updates.
* **You can be an author of an Independent Publisher Connector** – so, let’s review the independent publisher program in this neat 5-step process. Propose (tell all what you’re working on, fork repo, submit PR), Build (code, security, test flow, screen shots), Document (details on connector and actions), Prepare (validate files), and Submit (check all items completed, add screenshots). Please allow Microsoft a few weeks to validate your submission.
