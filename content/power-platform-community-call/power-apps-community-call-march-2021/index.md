## Demos

-   **Creating a responsive Power App running Dataverse in Teams** --
    Minor configuration tips elevates OOB responsiveness to next level. 
    Start with responsive containers template -- layout for header,
    footer, and page body (gallery control).  Create a form screen, same
    structure -- header, footer, body (form control).   Connect gallery
    and form to data source (table).  Connect gallery and form together
    using item property.  Data collected in form is stored in Dataverse,
    rendered in gallery item.  
-   **Automating metadata tagging with AI using Power Automate** -- Need
    to scan and tag 15k inconsistently formatted documents annually that
    are uploaded to a SharePoint document library?  Presenter evaluated
    3 capable options (OneDrive, OCR, Computer Vision) and based on
    technology strengths/limitations, choose Azure's Cognitive
    Services - Computer Vision Read API that's called from the shown
    Power Automate flow.   Customer updates keyword mapping in a list
    rather than in the Flow.   
-   **Getting started with Power Apps ALM** -- The Power CAT team has
    built 2 ALM Accelerators for Business Maker (Makers) and Advanced
    Maker audiences.  Accelerators automate the process of packaging up
    a Power Apps Solution and all supporting components for complete and
    documented movement between environments -- Dev, Text, Prod.  Source
    control in GitHub or Azure DevOps.  Makers Accelerator available now
    in CoE Starter Kit.   ALM for Advanced Makers is in Private
    preview.
