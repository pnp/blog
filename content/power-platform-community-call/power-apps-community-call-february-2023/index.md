### Demo summaries

* **Developing a personal wellness app to prevent burnout using Power Apps and SharePoint** – a Power Apps app that addresses job burnout using 2 approaches - actions that lead to positive developments and refocusing after reflecting. Uses SharePoint Lists, Power Apps and Power Automate (for reminders). Randomly delivered cards explore the user’s wellbeing and prompts for actions/reflections. SharePoint stores tips, prompts and reflections. Step through the logic for presenting information based on person’s energy level – pre and post reflection. [aka.ms/Feb15-Demo1](https://aka.ms/Feb15-Demo1)
* **Power Platform Release Planner - your new superpower!** – key features include feature search, my release planner, collaboration through notes, filtering (by date or functionality), use the API to retrieve release plans and ability to share release plans. Tool walkthrough. Power Platform and Dynamics products organized by what is Planned, Coming soon and Try now. For selected feature, - see when last updated, public preview date, and share button. Release wave notes and documentation. [aka.ms/Feb15-Demo2](https://aka.ms/Feb15-Demo2)
* **How to use "when an action is performed" trigger in Power Automate** – a practical introduction to event driven architecture. Structure your flow so that other people in your tenant can plug their own logic (child flows?) into it. Learn about the Plugin Registration Tool. Step through Registering a Custom API and adding it to your Power Automate trigger. Essentially, you are splitting the flow logic into separate components that others can hook without impacting the core flow/app. [aka.ms/Feb15-Demo3](https://aka.ms/Feb15-Demo3)
