### Demo summaries

* **Cracking the Code: Demystifying the Data Outputs in Power Automate** – a bookings appointment request trigger example. Problem - bookings requests come in and you need to get custom question responses out that are stored in an array of objects. Solution - use a compose action to generate new JSON for use in later actions. Look at action outputs, specifically a triggerOutputs(). Step through getting output values, understanding the output, and key take aways. Conversation - aka.ms/June21-Demo1
* **Dataverse security tips and tricks** – Dataverse is a database and a governance tool! Governance includes security. Problem statement - we have hundreds of environments, and our makers need to easily figure out where to make! The presenter will have you look at Groups Teams (security for low code), core roles in Dataverse you need to care about, and then build a custom environment picker to address where to make question. Conversation - aka.ms/June21-Demo2
* **How to Prepare for Microsoft Power Platform Certifications** – overview on Microsoft Certification types, expirations, where to begin, certifications chart, training and certification guide, why get certified, exams, results, certification renewals, learning resources, skills measured, Exam Sandbox, exam readiness zone, sample questions, practice assessments, learning materials on YouTube, books (note last updated date), Training (Udemy, Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Partner University), discount offers, employer support, study tips, preparation including spinning up a dev environment!
