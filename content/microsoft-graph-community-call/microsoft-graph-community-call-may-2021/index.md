This month's community call features presentations on Application
Consent Deep Dive (demystifying permissions and consent when accessing
Microsoft Graph) and on Considerations for Creating Online Meetings
(**Integration into Outlook or into other 3^rd^ party experiences)**. 
Q&A in this call after demos, at end and in chat.  The call was hosted
by [Brian T. Jackett](https://twitter.com/BrianTJackett) (Microsoft) |
@BrianTJackett. Microsoft
Presenters were Philippe Signoret and Fabian Williams.  Recorded on May
4, 2021.

 

## Topics

**App Consent Deep Dive -** demystifying permissions and consent when
accessing Microsoft Graph.  Most Graph permissions allow access to
*lots* of data.  Learn how apps and services access Microsoft Graph
resources - application permissions and delegated permissions,
requesting permissions, granting permissions, and restricting data
access scope.  General concepts -- direct access, access on behalf of
user, app and user authorizations, permission types, service principals,
consents and more.

 

**Considerations for creating Online Meetings -** Based on specific
meeting requirements, create an Online Meeting through the Calendar
Events API or through the Cloud Communications API (Teams).  Step
through 7 questions to ask yourself to decide when to use what method. 
The decision is largely based on the need for a rich integrated
Microsoft client (Outlook/Teams) experience vs 3^rd^ party application
integration including Microsoft chat integration.
