## Topics

**Assignments API --** specifically the Assignment Graph API v1.0 will
be released in Microsoft Teams EDU tenants within days.  The APIs align
to an instructor's workflows around assignments -- create, append
resources, track submissions, grade and post results back to students. 
 Try out the APIs in the Graph Explorer tool.   Think of a Team as a
Class, and assignments are the class activities/coursework.     


**Dev Tips and Tricks with Microsoft Graph -** Save time with 2 VS Code
Extensions 1) MS Graph Completion (autocompletion for Microsoft Graph
URLs)  and 2) Microsoft Graph Essentials (Preview) (CSS Completion and
HTML web component attributes, if using MGT) inside Visual Studio Code. 
Extensions created by presenter are available in Marketplace.  Microsoft
Graph Essentials extension comes with snippets, code completion for CSS
variables, and an extension pack. 


**Microsoft Graph Data Connect** - is about extracting information at
scale from Microsoft Graph.  Starting with an architecture overview --
learn about creating an Azure Data Factory, Azure storage account, and
establishing the data pipeline connection between the Microsoft 365
dataset and storage account.  Once the pipeline is setup, define source
and sink, trigger the sync and use Power BI to display data insights.
