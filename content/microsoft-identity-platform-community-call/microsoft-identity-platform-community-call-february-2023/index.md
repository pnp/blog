## Call summary

This month’s in-depth topic: **Get your Apps ready for Zero Trust.** 

Conditional Access is the policy engine for Zero Trust architecture in Azure AD, blocking or giving limited access to resources based on many signals or conditions. If your application is not capable of properly identifying the device where it is running, it cannot fulfill the Zero Trust principle "Verify explicitly". Verify explicitly implies that authentication and authorization should use all available data points, including device information. In this session we will share what you need to know so your app can send device information to Azure AD, covering multiple scenarios on different operating systems, browsers, native apps and including when and how to use brokers. Microsoft Presenter: [Marcus Carvalho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusca/) - Senior Product Manager (Microsoft) \| @marcusca10.
