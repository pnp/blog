## Call summary

This month’s in-depth topic: **Staying Up to Date with Authentication for JavaScript Applications** 

Microsoft is continually improving the Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) to benefit Microsoft web properties and your custom JavaScript applications. By staying up to date with the latest MSAL versions, your web application will receive the latest innovations on security, resiliency, and usability as they are released. If your application is still on ADAL, migrating to MSAL will enable pro-active token refreshing, extended outage resiliency, and improved OIDC-compliant flows moving from implicit flow to auth code token. Join this session to learn more about how your JavaScript application can leverage the latest features. Microsoft Presenters: [Emily Lauber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emlauber/) – Product Manager and [Doğan Erişen](https://github.com/derisen) - Software Engineer. 

## Topic/Demo Summaries

**Staying Up to Date with Authentication for JavaScript Applications** – take advantage of continuous updates to the Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) features addressing security, resiliency, and usability as they are released. Presentation covers - what is MSAL.js?, what can you use it for?, what changed since ADAL?, why should you stay up-to-date on the latest MSAL version? Latest on app configuration authority differences, redirect URI differences, API permissions differences, and supported account types.

**Migrating your solutions from ADAL.js to MSAL** – will enable pro-active token refreshing, extended outage resiliency, and improved OIDC-compliant flows moving from implicit flow to auth code token. Coding demo stepping through sample migration of a SPA from ADAL to MSAL. Observe ADAL vs MSAL API surface (method name/signature changes, promises vs callbacks, accounts vs users, and error handling) and review token caching & renewal behavior.
