## Call summary

This month’s in-depth topic: **Understand the world of Azure AD extensions and their role in Application integration.** Different organizations have different needs for user attributes and how they’re stored. Some user attributes need to be stored on-premises and synched, and some of them cannot be directly stored on-premise. Some attributes need to be stored as custom extensions, or MS Graph extensions, or even sometimes stored as claims. In this session, you will learn about the different types of extensions, and how and when to use them in claims mapping policies or through our UX. We will also talk about new upcoming features related to these extensions and how to simplify your integrations. Microsoft Presenters [Jeevan Desarda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevansd/) and [Allison Amaral](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonamaral/). This call was hosted by [Nandeesh Swami](https://twitter.com/Nandeesh_Swami) (Microsoft) \| @Nandeesh_Swami on September 15, 2022. Questions addressed liv and in chat throughout the call.
