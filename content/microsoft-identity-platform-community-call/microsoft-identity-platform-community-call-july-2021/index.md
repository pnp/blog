## Call summary


This month's in-depth topic:  **From zero to hero with Microsoft Graph
API**.   This session opens with an overview of Microsoft Graph services
and the Microsoft Graph Explorer tool.  Then the presenter dives into
access and permissions - source and access tokens, and REST API for CRUD
operations including querying examples -- filter, select, paging,
batching, and throttling in Graph Explorer.  There is a substantive
review of metadata (queryable resources and their JSON structure, types,
properties...), and finally options for automation & DevOps (app
registration, OAuth, policies, deployment).  This session was delivered
by Microsoft Program Managers Christer Ljung and Rohit Gulati and was
recorded on July 15, 2021.  Live and in-chat Q&A throughout call.
