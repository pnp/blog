## Call summary

This month's in-depth topic:  **A Zero Trust primer for
developers**.  In this session, we begin by introducing developers
quickly to the core Zero Trust principles: **Verify explicitly**, **Use
least privilege access**, and **Assume breach**.  We then expand why
developer's participation is critical in supporting Zero Trust policy
rollouts by the IT team. We then proceed to lay down a few steps that
developers can take to begin their journey towards building a good Zero
trust ready app. We start with learning how to effectively use claims
provided in tokens to [verify a user/subject explicitly]{.underline},
and then continue to discuss recommended practices for mobile apps. The
**Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)** feature is discussed in detail
for developers, and we hope it will help jumpstart a developer's journey
to this absolutely critical piece of security that is becoming a must
for all cloud apps. We then proceed to discuss a few steps to enable
**least privilege**, like how to best publish and consume permissions
for an API and then we finally move to discuss topics that help apps
[recover swiftly from breaches]{.underline}, like practicing solid
credential hygiene, and logging rich information.

 

Bottom line -- developers play a critical role in building trustworthy
applications as transition from *a culture of implicit trust to that of
explicit verification*.  The full developer guide of practices to build
a Zero trust app is available at **aka.ms/ztdev**.

 

This session was delivered by Kalyan Krishna - Sr Program Manager,
Microsoft.  Recorded December 16, 2021. Q&A in chat and at end of call.
