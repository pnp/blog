In this month's community call, there is

- a quick roadmap update -- 9
features in development to be delivered in Schema versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
over the next 3 months.
- Then there is a deep dive with demos and Q&A,
focused on the Action. Execute feature and underlying Universal Actions
Model for Microsoft Teams, Outlook and more, rolling out mid-April in
Schema v1.4.
- The new Action.Execute action type synchronizes activity
(payload) in the back-end while rendering cards natively in Teams and
Outlook front-ends.   Developers no longer need to build separate
applications for each environment.
- The call was hosted by Matt
Hidinger (Microsoft). Presenters include Shiladitya Saha (Microsoft Teams) and Karan Thapar (Microsoft Outlook).  Recorded on March 11, 2021.



## Demo

### Deep dive into Universal Actions for Microsoft Teams and Outlook

cards authored using the new **Action.Execute** action type "just work"
in Teams chats, Outlook emails and more thanks to seamless back-end
activity synchronization.  Action.Execute can return a new card to
replace the current one.   Several light demos show the experience. 
Also shown: **Contextual views in Teams bots/adaptive cards** - allows
specific users to have individualized cards and **Sequential Workflows
support on Teams** - progress through a multi-step process in a single
adaptive card using auto invoke and synchronized refresh capabilities.
