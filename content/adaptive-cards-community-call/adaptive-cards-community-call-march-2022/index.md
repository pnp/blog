## Demo

**Demo 1:  Adaptive Cards Host Control in Microsoft PnP Library –** customers want same functionality, different UI.  Needed a way to change UI at runtime (no recompiling required).  This SPFx solution contains a web part that hosts an AdaptiveCardhost control.   Same web part can be used in a SharePoint page, Teams tab and Teams personal app.   Hear the rationale behind this React control, why use the Adaptive Cards SDK, Fluent UI, and how control is implemented. 

**Demo 2:  Designer Device Emulator** - created by the Teams Platform group, this emulator shows Adaptive Card layouts for selected screen widths/resolutions.  Desktop (unconstrained), small mobile (320px), large mobile (414px), small tablet (768px), large tablet (1024px).    If you host your own Designer, then you can add additional resolution options.  Great for mobile projects.  Emulator will show up on AdaptiveCards.io shortly.
