In this episode of the weekly discussion revolving around the latest news and topics on Microsoft 365, host ‚Äì [Vesa Juvonen](https://twitter.com/vesajuvonen) (Microsoft) and [Waldek Mastykarz](https://twitter.com/waldekm) (Microsoft) are joined by [Nathalie Leenders](https://twitter.com/NathLeenders) Power Platform developer in the Netherlands.

We really really really tried again to get this to 60 minutes and failed miserably - seems that it actually gets longer the harder we try. It's the silent Finn, who just can't stop talking. We will keep on trying. Hopefully you enjoy the episode regardless.

## In this episode

- The evolution of form- and process creation tools on Microsoft 365
- The impact of the community on the career
- What's the value of employees participating in the community for the employer?
- How do you become an MVP?
