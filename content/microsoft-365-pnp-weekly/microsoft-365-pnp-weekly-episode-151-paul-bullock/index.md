In this installment of the weekly discussion revolving around the latest news and topics on Microsoft 365, hosts – [Vesa Juvonen](https://twitter.com/vesajuvonen) (Microsoft) | @vesajuvonen, [Waldek Mastykarz](https://twitter.com/waldekm) (Microsoft) | @waldekm are joined by UK-based SharePoint developer, architect and MVP, [Paul Bullock](https://twitter.com/pkbullock) | @pkbullock

Topics discussed in this session:

*   Paul’s work in Office and SharePoint tool development and architecture, in PnP project coordination and beyond.
*   How to get to be an MVP and why it matters?
*   Giving everyone a voice - the practice of bringing people into conversations.
*   Coordinating an open-source Script gallery – making it easy to contribute, attracting contributions, providing loose guidance, along with personal learnings and project evolution.
*   Advantages of keeping samples in a shared PnP Repo as opposed to in Personal Repos.

We also covered 18 articles published by Microsoft and the PnP Community over the last week. 

## This week

*   **Waldek** – working on v5 of CLI for Microsoft 365 – shipping around end of February.  Soliciting feedback on the idea of Quick Reference Cards for Microsoft 365 Apps, i.e., I need to build a bot, what resources do I need?   See article from Waldek below. 
*   **Vesa** – re-enabling look book provisioning after a maintenance break and prepare SPFx v1.14 documentation for GA

Please remember to keep on providing us feedback on how we can help on this journey. We always welcome feedback on making the community more inclusive and diverse.
