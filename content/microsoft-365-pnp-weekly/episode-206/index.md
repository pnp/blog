## Topics discussed in this session

* Top business priorities in Europe today - Security and Compliance, migrating on-prem apps to the cloud, and projects that support remote workforce.
* Cloud infrastructure benefits – secure, trusted with the incredibly powerful threat modeling and vulnerability assessment tools that companies would be hard pressed to acquire/implement on their own.
* Challenge - smaller company’s low code solutions logic is not documented which slows cloud migration.
* Strategies for accelerating enterprise technology adoption – infrastructure maturity, previous migration experience, addressing the Air gaps.
* How enterprises are maximizing/scaling their cloud investments.
* Why go to the European Collaboration Summit in May?
