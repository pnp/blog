## Topics discussed in this session

*   Thoughts on swimming into his 4th week as Community Lead in Microsoft’s
    Power Platform Team.

*   Bringing the Microsoft 365 PnP digital Recognition (Credly) program from
    idea to reality. The program’s target audience, qualification, validation,
    badges, employer recognition, program growth and co organizers.

*   Growing the mental mindset of the Sharing is Caring program including
    training events and a gem - the Buddy System.

*   Success comes both with understanding just enough about every product and
    service under the Microsoft 365 umbrella to assemble a solution and with
    knowing experts to ask for help.

*   Three tips to anyone wanting to get started in the PnP Community.



We also covered 9 articles published by Microsoft and the PnP Community over the last week.
