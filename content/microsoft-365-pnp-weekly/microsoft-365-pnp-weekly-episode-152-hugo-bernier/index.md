In this installment of the weekly discussion revolving around the latest news and topics on Microsoft 365, hosts – [Vesa Juvonen](https://twitter.com/vesajuvonen) (Microsoft) | @vesajuvonen, [Waldek Mastykarz](https://twitter.com/waldekm) (Microsoft) | @waldekm are joined by Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect and MVP Alum, [Hugo Bernier](https://twitter.com/bernierh) (Microsoft) | @bernierh. 

Topics discussed in this session:

*   Hugo’s Day job as a Cloud Solution Architect – focusing on Power Platform adoption - effectively teaching customers how to take advantage of products they already own in context of their existing IT infrastructure.   
*   Hugo’s Night job - working on community initiatives like Sharing is Caring events and on Samples repositories – testing, organizing, tagging SPFx extension and web part samples. 
*   Working with customers to fine tune their governance models.  Three tiers of governance.  IT led (Mission critical), IT supported (Infrastructure support), and Personal Productivity initiatives (no support).
*   Rationale for building solutions with Power Platform vs C#.   The question – are we building infrastructure capabilities once that will support many projects or building a local app? 
*   Latest focus – Dev containers (Docker).   Creating remote containers in VSCode that allow developers to open cloud-based samples in the environment they were built.  Use of Dev Containers / Codespaces will be demoed during the February 10th SPFx Community call.

We also covered 22 articles published by Microsoft and the PnP Community over the last week. 

## This week

*   **Waldek** – focused on making it easier for Angular developers to build/modify LOB apps for (also) use in Teams.
*   **Vesa** – SPFx v1.14 updates to product, documentation, tutorials for upcoming release.
*   **Hugo** – hack-a-thon with large government customer, gearing up for [Microsoft 365 Conference](https://m365conf.com/), April 5-7th, Las Vegas.

Please remember to keep on providing us feedback on how we can help on this journey. We always welcome feedback on making the community more inclusive and diverse.
