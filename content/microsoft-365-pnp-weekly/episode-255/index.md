It's time for the final episode - "We ran out of bites". In this episode, the hosts [Vesa Juvonen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vesajuvonen/) (Microsoft) and [Waldek Mastykarz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waldekmastykarz/) (Microsoft) are looking back the journey of doing a weekly podcast 6 years in row (with few exceptions) and are sharing their future direction. They are not going away - simply looking into changing the process a bit and not having a weekly show, given the resource cost that has. Focus continues to be on the incredible community we have but we are simply changing the model a bit.

## In this episode

- Future of the podcast(s) with Waldek and Vesa
- Background story on running the show for 6+ years
- Learnings on running this kind of show for years
- Quick recap on changes since Episode 1
- Sneak peek on the future show(s) and direction for Waldek and Vesa within the podcast(s) side
