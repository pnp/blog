## Topics discussed in this session

* What attracted you to the Microsoft Power Platform back in 2016? Thoughts on Platform evolution since that time and on Partner opportunities?
* What is the need for a Power Platform Architect? The need is for a specialist’s guidance on using the Power Platform correctly including governance, policies, control of data, and to address functionality gaps remains necessary. And yes, professional developers are still needed as well!
* Why use the Microsoft Power Platform vs other options? What about quality vs speed – a balance or shift rather than a tradeoff.
* Why are you contributing to the open-source Power Platform Independent Publisher Connector program? It’s about the Community.
* What are your top 3 picks on Microsoft Power Platform 2022 release wave 2 features?

Also, we showcased 28 articles/videos published by Microsoft and the PnP Community in the last week.
