## Topics discussed in this session

* Career journey from school to Software Developer at start-up Xamarin, to Microsoft.
* Moving into a people manager role (lead) ‚Äì requires right mental mindset before stepping into role.
* The DevDiv or informally the Client App Innovation team's role within Microsoft is partnering with all Microsoft 365 orgs on creating awesome experiences for developers - make developers successful.
* How apps are being built have changed dramatically in recent years. The focus is on blending the best parts of pro code and low code for optimal developer/citizen developer experiences.
* Advice:
    * Value the newcomer's perspective.
    * Be intentional - discover a new technology, learn something new, share observations and make a new friend in the process.
    * Use the same product your customer is using and personally experience the pain and delight working with the product.
    * Mentor and be mentored.
    * Enjoy and enthusiastically crave learning and growing.
* Why create apps with Teams Toolkit? 1) It exposes you to the right content at the time, 2) It has a really fast inner dev loop and 3) It has a stated way to do cloud development including ease of adding Microsoft 365 and Azure Cloud resources to your project using [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) to deploy and manage Azure resources.
* Announced 3 new features in Teams Toolkit that will be announced at [Microsoft Build 2022](https://aka.ms/build)
    * **Scenario driven development templates** ‚Äì for notification and command & response style bots. (Preview now)
    * **Integration with other Microsoft 365 services**. Build for Teams, Outlook and Office using the Teams Toolkit. F5 to Outlook and F5 to Office experiences now. (Preview now)
    * **Integrated Tunneling** (Preview soon) yet another integrated F5 experience.
* Attend [Microsoft Build](https://aka.ms/build) May 24‚Äì26, 2022, and frequent the [Microsoft 365 Developer Blog](https://aka.ms/m365dev/blog) for late breaking announcements.
* Documentation - [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/visual-studio-overview)
