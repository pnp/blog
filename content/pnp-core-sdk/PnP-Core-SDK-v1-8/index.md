We've just published a new minor version of the [.NET PnP Core SDK](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk/docs) ([GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk)) with new features to use in your cross-platform SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams projects.

## Build SharePoint Online and Teams solutions in .NET on any platform using PnP Core SDK

The [PnP Core SDK](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk/docs) is an SDK designed to work for Microsoft 365. It provides a unified object model for working with SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams which is agnostic to the underlying APIs being called. The SDK provides an object model that's API agnostic, when you as a developer for example load a model (List, Team, Web,...) the SDK will use the best possible API for loading that model being for the most part Microsoft Graph v1.0 and SharePoint REST. Depending on the needs the SDK will use Microsoft Graph Beta calls and in some cases the CSOM endpoint (client.svc) is called. But the good thing is that all of this is transparent for you as developer! You'll have a consistent development experience regardless of the underlying APIs being called.

The SDK targets .NET Standard 2.0, .NET 5.0, [.NET 6.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/) and [.NET 7.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7/). Use the .NET 6.0 (LTS) or .NET 7.0 builds if you're using a modern .NET version, use .NET Standard 2.0 for backwards compatibility with .NET Framework 4.6.1+.

## New version of PnP Core SDK â€“ v1.8

Key new features introduced with the 1.8 release are:

- Support for [.NET 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7/). Note: this is the last release that will ship with .NET 5 binaries, .NET 5 is not supported anymore and it's highly recommended to upgrade your projects to .NET 6 (LTS version) or .NET 7.
- Support for getting and setting column defaults
- A new `IPnPContext` interface on `PnPContext` which supports mocking for use in testing
- Working with indexed properties and requesting re-indexing of a list or web
- RateLimit header support to prevent getting throttled
- For the admin library:
  - Removing site collections from the site collection recycle bin
  - Passing along group members when creating group connected sites
