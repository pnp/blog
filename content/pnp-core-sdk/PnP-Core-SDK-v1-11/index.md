We've just published a new minor version of the [.NET PnP Core SDK](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk/docs) ([GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk)) with new features to use in your cross-platform SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams projects.

## Build SharePoint Online and Teams solutions in .NET on any platform using PnP Core SDK

The [PnP Core SDK](https://aka.ms/pnp/coresdk/docs) is an SDK designed to work for Microsoft 365. It provides a unified object model for working with SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams which is agnostic to the underlying APIs being called. The SDK provides an object model that's API agnostic, when you as a developer for example load a model (List, Team, Web,...) the SDK will use the best possible API for loading that model being for the most part Microsoft Graph v1.0 and SharePoint REST. Depending on the needs the SDK will use Microsoft Graph Beta calls and in some cases the CSOM endpoint (client.svc) is called. But the good thing is that all of this is transparent for you as developer! You'll have a consistent development experience regardless of the underlying APIs being called.

The SDK targets .NET Standard 2.0, [.NET 6.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/), [.NET 7.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7/) and [.NET 8.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8/). Use the .NET 6.0 (LTS), .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 (LTS) builds if you're using a modern .NET version, use .NET Standard 2.0 for backwards compatibility with .NET Framework 4.6.1+.

## New version of PnP Core SDK â€“ v1.11

Key new features/fixes introduced with the 1.11 release are:

- Support for .NET 8.0
- Support for using the ILongRunningOperation interface to track the progress of long running operations
- Calling LoadAsync or EnsurePropertiesAsync on IFolder was broken
- Fixed the encoding of IPropertyValues (property bag) values when any of these chars was used in the property name: -./:<>|[]

- For the auth library:
  - Option to invoke external access provider asynchronously when using the ExternalAuthenticationProvider authentication provider

- For the admin library:
  - Group connecting team sites use the Microsoft Graph api for both application and delegated permissions
  - Fix issue to enumerate private/shared channel sites
  - Switched to the new multi-geo aware site enumeration endpoint
  - Leave 'Teamify' loop when Team already existed
  - Fix setting site collection admins for 'groupified' sites
