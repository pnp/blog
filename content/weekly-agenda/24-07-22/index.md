We want to give you a better overview on what's happening each week. This is a summary blog post of all the community activities such as community calls and presenters, newly uploaded videos, upcoming events and more ðŸš€ 

Get involved by joining a call! We host a variety of [community calls](https://aka.ms/community/calls) each week, where we demo solutions, announce new features and where you can connect with like-minded people. These calls are for everyone to join, simply download the recurrent invite and get involved. 

Want to demo on what you have created or figured out with the out-of-the-box features? - absolutely welcome. [Volunteer for a demo spot](https://aka.ms/community/request/demo).
