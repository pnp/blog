This is a weekly summary blog post of all the community activities such as community calls and presenters, newly uploaded videos, upcoming events and more 🚀

This week we are back with the normal schedule with at least two community calls each week. One on Tuesday with Microsoft powered demos and one on Thursday with community demos.

Get involved by joining a call! We host a variety of [community calls](https://aka.ms/community/calls) each week, where we demo solutions, announce new features and where you can connect with like-minded people. These calls are for everyone to join, simply download the recurrent invite and get involved. 

Want to demo on what you have created or figured out with the out-of-the-box features? - absolutely welcome. [Volunteer for a demo spot](https://aka.ms/community/request/demo).
