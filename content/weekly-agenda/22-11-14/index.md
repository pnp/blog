We want to give you a better overview on what's happening each week. This is a summary blog post of all the community activities such as community calls and presenters, newly uploaded videos, upcoming events and more ðŸš€

**Notice -** this week the times of the calls might be a bit different due the summer time differences across the areas. If you download the recurrent meeting, times are assigned properly. As an example - the calls are one hour earlier this week for most of the Europe, as the winter time adjustment for US happens one week later.

## Community Calls

Get involved by joining a call! We host a variety of [community calls](https://aka.ms/m365/calls) each week, where we demo solutions, announce new features and where you can connect with like-minded people. This is the agenda for the following week:
