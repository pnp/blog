We want to give you a better overview on what's happening each week. This is a summary blog post of all the community activities such as community calls and presenters, newly uploaded videos, upcoming events and more 🚀 

Get involved by joining a call! We host a variety of [community calls](https://aka.ms/community/calls) each week, where we demo solutions, announce new features and where you can connect with like-minded people. These calls are for everyone to join, simply download the recurrent invite and get involved. 

Want to demo on what you have created or figured out with the out-of-the-box features? - absolutely welcome. [Volunteer for a demo spot](https://aka.ms/community/request/demo).

{{< notice tip>}}
It's that time of the year again - Schedules are adjusted with the Daylight Savings updates as we move towards winter in Northern hemisphere. As Europe and US move their time in different weeks, next week's meetings might be impacted for you. If you have downloaded the recurrent invites from https://aka.ms/community/calls, those are automatically adjusted in your calendar.

This year Daylight Savings ends in Europe on 27th of October and in US on 3rd of November. This means that the schedule can look strange for one week. If Daylight Savings are not used within your country, meetings schedule will be adjusted again for the winter period in the Northern hemisphere.
