Get involved by joining a call! We host a variety of [community calls](https://aka.ms/community/calls) each week, where we demo solutions, announce new features and where you can connect with like-minded people.

Want to demo on what you have created or figured out with the out-of-the-box features? - absolutely welcome. [Volunteer for a demo spot](https://aka.ms/community/request/demo).
