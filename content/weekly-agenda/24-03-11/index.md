We want to give you a better overview on what's happening each week. This is a summary blog post of all the community activities such as community calls and presenters, newly uploaded videos, upcoming events and more ðŸš€ 

Get involved by joining a call! We host a variety of [community calls](https://aka.ms/community/calls) each week, where we demo solutions, announce new features and where you can connect with like-minded people. These calls are for everyone to join, simply download the recurrent invite and get involved. Want to demo what you have created? - absolutely welcome. [Voluteer for a demo spot](https://aka.ms/community/request/demo).

{{< notice important>}}
As US moved already to Daylight Savings Time on 10th of March, timings of the calls can be a bit off within your calendar, depending on your country and Daylight Savings Time model. For example for Europe, we are back to normal timings starting from 30th of March when Europe moves to Daylight Savings time. 

If you download the recurrent invites of the meetings, those are automatically correctly aligned in your calendar. Sorry for the inconvience this might cause.
