This is a weekly summary blog post of all the community activities such as community calls and presenters, newly uploaded videos, upcoming events and more 🚀

Get involved by joining a call! We host a variety of [community calls](https://aka.ms/community/calls) each week, where we demo solutions, announce new features and where you can connect with like-minded people. These calls are for everyone to join, simply download the recurrent invite and get involved. 

Want to demo on what you have created or figured out with the out-of-the-box features? - absolutely welcome. [Volunteer for a demo spot](https://aka.ms/community/request/demo).

This is the agenda for the upcoming week:

### Microsoft 365 & Power Platform product updates - 23rd of December

* Cancelled call due to holiday season 🎄 - Next call is on 13th of January


### Microsoft 365 & Power Platform community demos call - 25th of December

* Thursday, 25th of December, 7:00 AM PT / 3:00 PM GMT
* Download the [recurring invite](https://aka.ms/community/m365-powerplat-call-invite) or [join the call](https://aka.ms/spdev-sig-call-join) we'd love to see you in the call!
